After ending the hostilities with which he will be the next MotoGP world champion, he has granted an interview in  La Gazzetta </ ​​em> that has left no one indifferent. The Spanish driver spoke about his departure from Ducati, the arrival at Honda and the reasons that led to it. </p> <p>  Ducati title expectations  </p> <p> 'I am sure that the third year would have had better results, to reach Ducati for me was like changing category, the difference was huge and both they and I underestimated the change. Ducati thought he had signed a three-time world champion who was going to win the title the first year. Ducati did not believe my words that there really was not much left. I was saying it to <strong> Dall'Igna or Domenicali </strong>. I was missing that little piece that would physically allow me to be quick throughout the race. '</p> <p>  Dovizioso's salary  </p> <p>' They should have thought They had a world champion and try to give me what I needed. Instead, they planned to raise the salary of <strong> Dovizioso </strong>, which was winning some races, and sign a cheaper strong driver. He knows how to use words very well. Maintaining a relationship is difficult. I have always tried to be respectful to him. By the time he won and I was suffering, I was happy for the team. The relationship deteriorated when I realized that he did not have the same attitude towards me. He also did it before the press. So I said, enough. '</p> <p>  A new life in Honda  </p> <p>' If the relationship is good and you make friends and have fun , better, but what matters is winning. <strong> Alberto Puig </strong> is like me, I like demanding people with themselves and with others. And they are clear, they say things to your face, without trying to be diplomatic or to please you. Surely Márquez will also become stronger. With Valentino we both raised the level because neither wanted to be the slowest. '</p>",Jorge Lorenzo is still at the center of all the lights after his polemic last Sunday with Marc Márqu...

When I put myself first, I saved a little. I kept calm until I saw Valentino coming. I had to force when I saw him: in those 3 or 4 laps he was the key to the race, when I got a second and a half, 'said a <strong> Márquez </strong>, who is satisfied with his advantage in front of the world. 'If you tell me that I leave <strong> Sachsenring </strong> with 46 points I would have signed it. It has not been as I expected it to be. Lucky that both <strong> Yamaha </strong> are wrong (laughs). I was hoping to have more here, it's been a lot harder than last year. '</p> <p> A big part of the blame for this leadership falls on the <strong> Honda de Márquez </strong>, a motorcycle that according to the pilot every time has more potential.

There have even been times when you could dream of a duel between them until the last round. But no, when there were twelve laps to go, Marc has hit a cramp that has allowed him to leave easily. Rossi has not had any answer, although his second place is quite meritorious if we take into account that Friday he finished the free 17th. </p> <p> Once the race was decided, the interest was focused on seeing who achieved the third step of the podium. , which has finally been for a <strong> Maverick Viñales </strong> that has recovered from a bad start. It is not the first time that happens to the Spanish, and it is something that weighs heavily in the face of achieving good results. The one of <strong> Yamaha </strong> has been imposed on Petrucci and a reborn Álvaro Bautista, whose <strong> Ducati </strong> have beaten the two officials, since Dovizioso has entered the finish line just behind Lorenzo and ahead de Pedrosa. </p> <p> After this result the World Championship is more than on track for <strong> Marc Márquez </strong>, which gets 46 points to the second classified, Valentino Rossi.

The coach did not take Sevilla to <strong> Carvajal </strong>, that everything points to the return to the mattresses, while <strong> Odriozola </strong> also stayed out as a precaution.

The association criticizes that the formation 'dwelling' is based on arguments such as '<strong> at a higher price, greater is the slice that the agencies take </strong>', which in his opinion is thus favored the '<strong> speculation </strong> '; and the difficulties of young people in accessing housing, among other reasons, <strong> for having to pay real estate agencies. </strong> </p> <p> For the AOSIS, the affirmations of Podemos demonstrate <strong> > 'His ignorance about the real estate mediation sector' </strong>. The president of the APEI, Óscar Martínez, says he understands the 'good will' of Podemos when trying to favor access to the housing market, but believes that the measures he proposes are <strong> 'as unfair as they are unviable'. </strong> </p> <p> Likewise, he points out that the real estate mediation sector needs a regulation that provides transparency and improves the profession, and does not measure <strong> 'opportunistic and baseless'. </strong> </p> <p> According to Martínez, the arguments of Podemos favor the <strong> 'discredit of this profession and demonstrate ignorance of reality' </strong> and points out that '<strong> it is unthinkable to charge for services that are not lend </strong> and, moreover, in a real estate agency there are many operations that do not come to fruition and in these cases is not charged for them. '</p> <p> On the affirmations of Podemos that relate the mediation with speculation, Martínez clarifies that 'the function of the agent and real estate is to try to make prices more adjusted to the market. 'On very few occasions we tell the seller that the price he proposes is cheap, on the contrary. Our work as mediators is voluntary, unlike other sectors, where the consumer can not avoid them, 'he adds. </p> <p> In this sense, he insists that it is' totally voluntary 'that the buyer and seller use these services, although many people go to the agencies because they see 'the importance and need to resort to a specialized advisor on something as important as the purchase of a home'. </p> <p> Regarding the new modalities that <strong> ' they believe they are replacing conventional agencies, but what they do is sell services and charge based on them, without offering the service of the traditional agency '</strong>, points out that they do not know any of these online agencies that do not copper for its services. </p> <p> The president of APEI also explains that <strong> 'there are very few costs that young people face to access housing that result in income for the agency' </strong> and remember that 'endorsements or Surety bonds are not in favor of the real estate agent, but of the owner. '</p> <p> Likewise, remember that the commissions correspond to the payment of the professional service and advice that the real estate agent develops and that <strong>' in an agency they are many operations that do not come to fruition and in these cases is not charged for them. '</strong> </p> <p> Regarding the limitation of the fees charged by real estate agencies for their services, the president of the AOSIS, remember that <strong> 'in a free market can not regulate the fees.' </strong> </p> <p> However, the real estate experts advocates a regulation that requires the real estate to act with greater transparency. Since 2000, when <strong> real estate mediation was deregulated, </strong> consider that they are the <strong> sector 'forgotten' by the Administration </strong>, except in Catalonia, which has been in force since 2010 Obligatory of Real Estate Agents. In other communities, measures are being introduced through a voluntary registry, as in the case of the community of Madrid. </p> <p> However, the APEI is not satisfied because it considers that it must be enforced in order to be able to exercise as a real estate agent 'in a context in which thousands of new <strong> agencies opened in 2017 without any requirement or requirement for the consumer'. </strong> </p>","The Association of Real Estate Experts (APEI) , which groups together more than 1,200 real estate ag..."

He intended to return to the regulation that existed in the government stage of J <strong> osé Luis Rodríguez Zapatero </strong>. Then, in the event of the Senate's veto on the spending ceiling, it allowed for a simple majority in the Congress. </p> <p> That bill has been taken into consideration in the plenary session of the Congress on Tuesday, which is the first time step in the parliamentary tour, but, regardless of its processing, the PSOE has wanted to take advantage of a 'shortcut' in the first organic law whose term of amendments ended in Congress, a proposed law of urgent measures against sexist violence. </p> <p> The PSOE has adopted this amendment as an amendment to an alien legislative initiative, specifically a proposal for an organic law of urgent measures against sexist violence. This is a reform of the organic law of the judiciary, which therefore has the same legal status as the Law of Budgetary Stability. </p> <p> The amendment, like the original law proposal debated on Tuesday in The Plenary Session of the Congress modifies Article 15.6 of the Budget Stability Law to ensure that, in the event of a veto by the Senate on the path of the deficit, it may be lifted in Congress with a simple majority. </p> <p> With this parliamentary 'shortcut', used on previous occasions by the governments of the PP and the PSOE, the Socialists try to ensure a fast track to amend the Stability Law without having to depend on the PP and Citizens, who have a majority at the table of the Congress, allow the original reform to be processed in a single reading. </p> <p> The first option will continue to be the express processing of the reform of the stability law, but if the PP and Citizens again prevent it in the Congress Table, he PSOE will have the way of this amendment in the <strong> law of male violence. </strong> </p> <p> </p>",The PSOE has taken advantage of the end of the term of amendments in the Congress of a proposal of l...

Most of them, despite not sharing content, had something in common: they ended up with a <strong> list of duties </strong> to implement the lesson learned. To put an end to the excess of tasks in the classrooms, a Spanish teacher has created an algorithm that allows <strong> teachers to coordinate to send homework. </strong> </p> <p> Luis Álvarez, along with engineer José María Guillén, have created Task & Time, <strong> a  startup  with a Spanish stamp </strong> that opens the door to a new way of teaching in the classroom. 'The tool enables the <strong> measurement of the workload of the studies with the Bologna Plan </strong>. It allows teachers to coordinate when sending homework to their students, 'explain its founders. </p> <p> To coordinate, the faculty has to decide <strong> what is the maximum volume of duties appropriate for each course </strong>, the <strong> frequency of breaks and their size </strong>. 'These variables are what create a virtual student that, in a general way, represents the class as a whole in each course'. </p> <p> After the teachers' consensus, they begin to introduce in a mobile application the tasks that they send their students daily. The App becomes a virtual calendar that also measures the estimated workload, diagnoses the causes of overloads and alerts teachers when the volume of work is very high for students. </p> <p> 'El Professor will always be able to see to what extent he is causing the overflows and adjusts to the decisions of the faculty on the duties ', explains the creator of the app. </p> <p> The application of Task & Time, <strong>  StudyTask , </strong> is designed to be implemented in the centers of <strong> higher education. </strong> In fact, one of its great achievements during this journey has been that a research team at the University Complutense <strong> has been interested in the proposal for its research. </strong> </p> <p> The <strong> Bologna Plan </strong> introduced a new European credit system (ECTS) in Spanish universities where the number of hours of <strong> compulsory attendance </strong> ac is taken into account Lase like those who should work outside the classroom (attending seminars, doing work, study hours, etc.). </p> <p> A system that <strong> from the Alvarez algorithm look with lup </strong> a , since it is able to determine if the number of hours that has been granted to each grade credit is officially fixed or not and measures whether the workload that has been established for each subject makes sense or does not. </p> <p> 'This application promises to revolutionize a system in which, at the moment, there is no clear and objective way to measure the performance of the student according to the hours of work that have been determined, nor technical means to coordinate the teachers so that students have a reasonable time to do it as expected, 'they explain. </p>","Imagine your time as students Beyond the expected time of recess, there were classes in Language and..."

'If it's a child who is being bullied, it comforts and advises.

This can be achieved through a strategy of transmitting values ​​and corporate social responsibility that congenies the expectations of the public with what is sent to it. </p> <p> There are, however, other ways of doing it. One of the most used is <strong>  licensing  </strong>. It consists of obtaining the <strong> right to use a trademark or intellectual property </strong> to be able to insert it into the product or service that is offered. It is an acquisition that does not tend to be infinite, but rather it is marked within a specific geographical term and scope. Obviously, the more powerful the license acquired, the longer the term and the wider the geographical area, the greater the amount (called <strong>  roylaty  </strong>) to which it is 
You will have to face it. </p> <p> The advantages of using this marketing strategy are the following: 
1.- Link the brand with a known image: one of the most common licensing actions is to acquire the rights to use a brand related to a movie or cartoon character that attracts the attention of children. During the time the relationship lasts, the public 'fan' of that will be attracted to acquire that product. </p> <p> 2.- Facilitates differentiation: in a market as competitive as the current one with a large number of products that satisfy very similar needs, it is complicated to generate a memory in the audience. Licensing is a good way to get it. </p> <p> 3.- Increase sales during that period: just by inserting the image of that recognized character, the company, with the same product, will be able to increase the sales. </p> <p> The aspects that a company must assess before embarking on a  licensing  are: </p> <p> 1.- Cost of the license: as commented , the increase in sales thanks to this strategy is practically assured. However, it is necessary to calculate if this increase in income compensates the investment that has been made in the acquisition of the license. </p> <p> 2.- Actions to be carried out once the license is finished: the company must have A plan to build customer loyalty once you can no longer link your brand with that element. We must bear in mind that such a strategy does not transmit a certain corporate image or values, but rather that
The attraction of linking to the image of another is simply achieved. </p> <p> Therefore, if the company wants to keep the clientele obtained, it must carry out image actions that allow it to continue associating it with the values and image of that license. </p>",One of the main objectives of any company is to achieve a emotional bond with the target audience . ...

However, that passion became a routine and four years ago he decided to turn 180º by collaborating with his father's company dedicated to the <strong> real estate sector </strong>. It was not until 2017 when, with his brother Albert, he decided to create a  spin-off  of the family company: he launched <strong> Ethic Investors </strong>, a platform for <strong>  crodwfunding  </strong> to <strong> invest in housing for 50 euros </strong>. </p> <p> The <strong> creation of this Participatory Financing Platform </strong> arises from the need that emerged in the crisis when companies and individuals financed by banks, <strong> had farms with credits that exceeded the value of their assets </strong>. 'In most cases it was more profitable to stop paying and losing assets through <strong> dations in payment or foreclosures, </strong> than to keep something that was worth less than the debt incurred. This model of <strong> real estate purchase without a mortgage </strong> made us overcome the crisis without stress, we are not financed by banks. '</p> <p> But how does it work? 'We share our <strong> traditional business model with investors. </strong> This formula is a  win-win : we share benefits and they sleep peacefully.' That is to say: there are no intermediaries. From Ethic <strong> find the farms, make the renovations, decorate the floors and make the sale with your commercials </strong>. Rodríguez points to the real estate companies and is critical of his model since, in his opinion, '<strong> they profit from sales </strong>, in most cases, without adding value'. </p> </p>  Invest from 50 euros  </p> <p> 'We wanted to deflower all those people who have never made investments in real estate.' The proposal to invest in housing from 50 euros has made <strong> customers  millenials  </strong> bet on this product, which, according to José, has no fine print and <strong> has a profitability between 15% and 25%. </strong> </p> <p> Ethic has closed three collective financing actions for homes in Barcelona and Girona with a <strong> investment of 616,000 euros </strong> and now, they are working on a campaign for an apartment in Mallorca. 'Thanks to new technologies we can cover the entire national territory. We are preparing <strong> opportunities in Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, </strong> Comunidad Valenciana, some points off the coast of Andalusia and Catalonia in general.

The goal is to get a sale by impulse in which rationality is set aside. </p> <p> It is precisely this rush that generates distrust. If the product is really good, why so much desperation to sell? If they are desperate, it will not be that they have not achieved what they expected? Does this imply, then, that your product is not as extraordinary as they present? </p> <p>  Most used impulse selling strategies  </p> <p> Latest units in stock at this price: it is common to see in the shop window of some establishments 'Last units', 'Opportunity' and the like. The problem comes when it is a simple tool to attract customers through deceptive advertising. If the same client who, days before, has gone to this place, sees exactly the same sign afterwards, he will feel a sense of deception. Therefore, he will not buy again in this place and, in addition, he will let his relatives know the lie. </p> <p> Possibility of getting coupons: in exchange for a certain purchase, it is determined that coupons can be obtained that will be useful for, in the future, buying other products. It is a tool that, for the company, implies a significant loss of margin, since a discount is being made. </p> <p> In addition, if the client does not really have interest in other products and, finally, acquires another one which also has not shown great interest, will be left with a bad memory of the company. </p>","In order to get a sale quickly, companies carry out practices that, in many consumers, cause a sense..."

The new mode of shared transport, driven by the <strong>  startup  Seville UFO </strong>, has two wheels and inspires adolescence: the <strong> electric scooter </strong>. Two young entrepreneurs, Mario and Victor, traveled to California and the scooters were 'everywhere. We saw the <strong> need to implement it in the European market and offer sustainable mobility </strong> in Spanish cities, 'explains Mario. </p> <p> The first asphalt they will use is <strong> Barcelon </strong> a, the 'Spanish language' and citizens who use it will have a  award  if they recharge these scooters: <strong> 4 euros </strong>. 'Users can leave the scooter in the place of the city they prefer. To carry out the loading of the scooters, UFO proposes its users <strong> to become  chager  in exchange for an economic remuneration. </strong> Users can earn an extra income of 4 euros for each scooter they load ', says the founder. </p> <p> The <strong> amount can increase because the load of scooters is unlimited. </strong> 'The use of the scooter is not directly related to the load. That is, a <strong> user can use a scooter and not be the one to load it </strong>. Likewise, there are users who can upload them without having used the service during that day.

'</p> <p> The key is not only in  the electric , but in  shared . 'Mobility is no longer treated from the point of view of possession, but to have access to it. It is shared mobility because <strong> several users use the same scooter on the same day </strong>. They optimize mobility resources and make use of them only when they need it. The idea is not that the user has the scooter all day, but <strong> use it only when you need it </strong> ', they indicate. </p> <p>  Unlock by 1 €  </p> <p> The number of scooters will depend on the demand and the size of the city. <strong> Unblocking it means spending one euro </strong> on the part of the user and then the price per service is <strong> 15 cents per minute </strong>. 'The scooters have a <strong> autonomy of 20 kilometers and are designed for an average of three daily uses </strong>', they add. </p> <p> Although it is not the first project they put into operation, it is the one that has marked them the most. They have overcome obstacles, they count, but it has been worth it. 'Not only for us but <strong> also for society and citizens </strong>,' Mario explains. </p> <p> The <strong> scooters have no gender, no age </strong>.

At the same time, the client is curious to know what is behind that and will show interest. </p> <p>  Demonstrate  </p> <p> It is the most visual method that exists. A commercial makes, before a group of potential customers, a series of jobs that can be done thanks to the product. In that sense, it is important to highlight and emphasize the problems that are solved. Thanks to the Internet and social networks, it is possible to post a demonstration and have millions of people see it and share it. The distance between company and consumer has been reduced, thanks to this. </p> <p>  Show positive feedback from users  </p> <p> The demonstration is a very interesting method, but when offered by a commercial, the client will always have the doubt if what he is witnessing is true or not. In the end, the commercial's ultimate goal is to sell and, for that reason, may have overlooked some negative aspect. It offers much more security, then, the opinion of someone who has tried the product and that has worked. </p> <p> For this reason, companies strive to get positive feedback from customers and that they share.

Their opinions are widely followed and their followers trust them when it comes to structuring their decisions.

In this way In addition to knowing possible aspects of improvement, the client is shown that there is a concern to offer the best possible service. </p> <p>  Offering other company products  </p> <p> Once all the information about the client's preferences and their degree of satisfaction with the company has been collected, the opportunity comes to offer other products that can match their needs.
