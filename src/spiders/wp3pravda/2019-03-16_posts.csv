Machine riveted attention and pompous name ""the Punisher"".</p><p>However, information about this little vehicle ""the Punisher"", by and large, secret development. Therefore, the exact characteristics of a little, there are only rumors, conjectures, yes the diversion. So, in the network from time to time there are pictures of ""the Punisher"", supposedly made in different regions of our country. For example, the car seen in the Crimea, Tatarstan, in the Caucasus (where, again according to rumors, she passed the baptism of fire). However, you can try to organize, and to draw up an adequate portrait.</p><p>As regards the concern-developer, information varies some sources say that the machine worked at KAMAZ, while others insist that development was engaged in ""ZIL"". Flash and other less large and well known company.<p><p>It is known that the creation of ""the Punisher"" began more than a decade ago, in the year 2008, the plant ""ZIL"". Initially, the head of the ambitious project was Svyatoslav Saakyan. According to rumors, the order for a similar car he received earlier in the year 2002, from the Defense Ministry.

But the problem is much broader. To solve it we need the political will.</strong></p><p>The Court of the Kirov District of Irkutsk on the lawsuit West of Baikal environmental Prosecutor's Office suspended Interdistrict in Friday the construction of a plant for bottling water for delivery to China. Reason for filing a lawsuit became the results of the investigation, which showed that the factory built on relic Talovskom bog, where nesting birds, included in the Red Book.</p><p>The plant began building in January this year on the shore of Lake Baikal in kultuk district. The investor is Daqing water company, which intends to spend on the construction of 1.5 billion rubles. The design capacity of the plant is 528 thousand liters of water per day, commissioning was planned for the year 2021.</p><p>In March, supervisors discovered construction ' traces the spill of petroleum products and on the perimeter of the site — piles construction rubbish '. As reported in a petition on Change.org to extraction of water will need to lay pipelines across the Lake with a length of more than 3 kilometers. Local residents are blocking access to the Lake, people will not be able to engage in fishing. The petition requires a stop (not paused) construction gathered already 926 400 signatures.<p><p>The Governor of the Irkutsk region Sergey Levchenkov informed its reply to the petition says that the project has received the support of federal and regional ministries of economic development and has received all permits. He acknowledged the violation of the norms of construction and developer signed an appeal to the Minister of natural resources and environment of RUSSIAN FEDERATION Dmitry Nikolayevich Kobylkina with a request to conduct an audit of the positive conclusion of the State environmental appraisal project documentation of the plant.</p><p>In Tuesday Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev promised to check the project construction of a plant for bottling water on Lake Baikal in environmental compliance.</p><p>Situation ' Roux '. <strong>commented Deputy Director, Institute of water problems of the RUSSIAN ACADEMY of SCIENCES Mikhail Bolgov</strong> .<p><p><strong>-Construction of the plant, which now all say, suspended.

If it was bought is quite another matter to another agency is not ours. Second, pick up from Baikal prektom quantity of water provided for sale no problem for Lake does not represent, as inflows — 60 cubic km per year, and pick up we just minuscule.

This is the basic concept. It should be implemented.</p><p><strong>— And this technology is, it is possible to observe?</strong></p><p>Of course, you can. But it is only worth the money that Chinese citizens are trying to save. Why should they invest if you can order a bulldozer that is already 50 years operated and from which half the diesel lead on the way to the place where they align. Goes the barbaric use of these resources in the complete absence of natural surveillance and its functions. In my opinion, our authorities enough any laws and everything else, that such construction sites shut down.</p><p>When the protected mode environmental zone, of course, should not be absolute prohibition regime.

But the problem is much broader. To solve it we need the political will.</strong></p><p>The Court of the Kirov District of Irkutsk on the lawsuit West of Baikal environmental Prosecutor's Office suspended Interdistrict in Friday the construction of a plant for bottling water for delivery to China. Reason for filing a lawsuit became the results of the investigation, which showed that the factory built on relic Talovskom bog, where nesting birds, included in the Red Book.</p><p>The plant began building in January this year on the shore of Lake Baikal in kultuk district. The investor is Daqing water company, which intends to spend on the construction of 1.5 billion rubles. The design capacity of the plant is 528 thousand liters of water per day, commissioning was planned for the year 2021.</p><p>In March, supervisors discovered construction ' traces the spill of petroleum products and on the perimeter of the site — piles construction rubbish '. As reported in a petition on Change.org to extraction of water will need to lay pipelines across the Lake with a length of more than 3 kilometers. Local residents are blocking access to the Lake, people will not be able to engage in fishing. The petition requires a stop (not paused) construction gathered already 926 400 signatures.<p><p>The Governor of the Irkutsk region Sergey Levchenkov informed its reply to the petition says that the project has received the support of federal and regional ministries of economic development and has received all permits. He acknowledged the violation of the norms of construction and developer signed an appeal to the Minister of natural resources and environment of RUSSIAN FEDERATION Dmitry Nikolayevich Kobylkina with a request to conduct an audit of the positive conclusion of the State environmental appraisal project documentation of the plant.</p><p>In Tuesday Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev promised to check the project construction of a plant for bottling water on Lake Baikal in environmental compliance.</p><p>Situation ' Roux '. <strong>commented Deputy Director, Institute of water problems of the RUSSIAN ACADEMY of SCIENCES Mikhail Bolgov</strong> .<p><p><strong>-Construction of the plant, which now all say, suspended. Do you think you can really build any production in that area? Baikal is our heritage, it hurts to see how his ruin.</strong></p><p>— Conclusions about the dangers surrounding Wednesday I will be able to do, getting documents environmental assessment if it was. If it was bought is quite another matter to another agency is not ours. Second, pick up from Baikal prektom quantity of water provided for sale no problem for Lake does not represent, as inflows — 60 cubic km per year, and pick up we just minuscule. It's a matter of production technology, will it violate the environmental conditions, accompanied by discharges of polluting substances, otpugivaniem wild birds is all we need to see. Project documents that should be specified, without all this authorization It was impossible to obtain.<p><p><strong>Is There oil spill were found during construction</strong>.</p><p>Is the problem of natural surveillance. It was supposed to prevent this building, once discovered the breach. We are not opposed to build something, but the surrounding Wednesday any industrial pollutants must be zero. This is the basic concept. It should be implemented.</p><p><strong>— And this technology is, it is possible to observe?</strong></p><p>Of course, you can. But it is only worth the money that Chinese citizens are trying to save. Why should they invest if you can order a bulldozer that is already 50 years operated and from which half the diesel lead on the way to the place where they align. Goes the barbaric use of these resources in the complete absence of natural surveillance and its functions. In my opinion, our authorities enough any laws and everything else, that such construction sites shut down.</p><p>When the protected mode environmental zone, of course, should not be absolute prohibition regime. Otherwise people live there, even if it is impossible to bury a relative and that cannot be. Therefore it is necessary to seek a balance, to good people lived, and to the nature of the damage was minimal. To do this, our environment and any security activity and exists. And we have already closed the water utechet along with fuel oil somewhere.<p><p>Note that this construction has become political because of the invasion of Chinese tourists and businessmen. Last year, the district was visited Olkhon 800 thousand tourists, most of them Chinese, while the population of Irkutsk-640 thousand people. The Chinese were allowed to build the plant, and local residents to prohibit individual housing construction, as we can see, even ' relatives to bury ', of course, it is necessary to regulate Chinese tourist flows, to do this just because we are talking about security zone — water area of the Lake Baikal.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> Sergey Zverev was summoned to the police for the unauthorized picket<p><p>Baikal could not improve for 8.4 billion roubles</p><p>Did Russia more expensive the Ganges than Baikal?</p><p>Embed the ' Truth.

No need to go to the movies to see such personally. Quite simply buy a ticket to the city of Rybinsk, Yaroslavl region.</p><p>There with the 2003 year LLC ' Firm ' ERM ' (located at: rybinsk, MCR-Strumming, naberezhnaya Street, building No. 10, on a plot of 10 383 square meters with a pier, which is federal property; landlord — the State ) uses the Volga River water area for inland waterway transport, as well as mining of river sand and gravel is a so-called non-metallic materials.

One of the main activities of the company MVK is a hydrotechnical construction, and on the basis of the enterprise, there is one of the most powerful pumps in the RF performance of 2000 cubic metres per hour and a large number of specialized equipment for construction and repair of hydraulic works.<p><p>Agreement on cooperation in emergencies concluded between LLC ' Firm ' ERM ' and Rybinskim the CSG is a branch of the RAMS ' Feed them.

However, on the road to enterprise signs prohibiting passage of cargo transport and signs limiting the load on the axle '.<p><p>This ' shenanigans ' rybinskih has not ended. In July 2016 year right before the gates of the enterprise on the considerable budget funds have established unique scales for weighing trucks. Such a ' triumphal arch ' in rybinsk hasn't been one other company besides the IICS.</p><p>When our money is managed by someone else's uncle, we shall endure. But when we and our children are facing imminent technological disaster because of what someone does something mindlessly banned or, roughly, ' pressed ' is already beyond good and evil. Why the administration of the city of Rybinsk refused this multidisciplinary water company in the conclusion the contract on the use of this water for object properties there swimming facilities, facilities and installations?<p><p>The rhetorical question, what ' screamy ' are going to take off in rybinsk, is the answer.</p><p>In the neighborhood there is another Sweeps, with the permission of the say way. So, no way, not a tract and a typical roadway with potholes and pits. According to our information, despite numerous appeals court decision and residents still have not waited for repair. As a consequence, all the food trucks and other trucks go to bypass this way. Right, they go through mcrd Strumming, causing legitimate discontent of local inhabitants.</p><p>Hiding behind the discontent of the residents of the neighborhood Sweeps through which an hour from power travels four or five cars, the ERM while on city streets in a matter of minutes dozens of trucks gromyhajut, the administration of the city of Rybinsk refused multidisciplinary water company to conclude a Treaty on the use of This water body for posting there swimming facilities and other facilities and installations, even without asking for data for monitoring the State of atmospheric air and noise '.<p><p>Note also that my LLC ' Firm ' ERM ' port is 500 metres from Rybinsk hydroelectric station dam, while nearby ports upstream of the Rybinsk reservoir (port of Uglich and Cherepovets port) are located in hundreds of kilometers.</p><p>And now remember recent instances of flooding towns and even cities on the territory of our country. How you think, how will soon come to the inhabitants of Rybinsk, if OOO ' Firm ' ERM ' cease to function? In case of catastrophe risk it all. Only, unfortunately, bureaucrats, mindlessly signing prohibitive documents, not as visionary and absolutely do not think that if trouble comes, suffer themselves, and their loved ones, not to mention the rest of the citizens.

Cultural policy in strengthening inter-ethnic peace and interreligious consent '? These and other questions<strong> ' truth. En ' </strong>the programme ' viewpoint '<strong> replied ethnologist and master of theology Galina Hizriev.</strong></p><p><strong>-What are the social and political processes taking place in the North Caucasus? How ordinary people are directly involved in all of this?</strong></p><p>""We found that interethnic and inter-religious communication, including with other countries and the diasporas living there, always somehow felt by those peoples. And all of a sudden those links become apparent. It is possible to participate, to restore this cultural context, make it personal process is alive and relevant. Just now there is opportunities to travel and participate in the life of its diaspora outside of Russia. But it has always been and the reverse process, it was also true influence.<p><p><strong>What are those people who want to run the reverse process? For what purpose?</strong></p><p>""I think they'll say we want simply to be reunited in the spirit. But ... This is exactly what starts and increased consciousness of peoples and their political subjectivity. We are not alone, we all have a great Motherland and a long history. As they say: we have more history and outside of Russia, we are part of global processes.</p><p><strong>This is positively or negatively for Russia in General? Or is it is inevitable?</strong> <strong>As the Center responds to these sentiments?</strong></p><p>This is a given. Positive or negative this story can do exactly only the reaction of the Russian authorities in this natural process. For example, South Ossetia and North Ossetia were divided, were in different States.</p><p>Nobody question the moment that North and South Ossetia represent actors, in which the population is Ossetian, persojazychnym first and foremost, and this cultural Foundation builds its subjectivity.<p><p>Consequently, some desire to influence others is a natural process. It is not good, it is not bad, but simply the inevitable liberalization throughout our life, including the political.</p><p>As this might include Russian power? It has already supported the struggle for the independence of South Ossetes and recognized the independence of that Republic. Also Syria and several States recognize South Ossetia subject of international life and law.</p><p><strong>-From the South Ossetia easier? How do they live? People satisfied? They got everything they wanted, or something else?</strong></p><p>Is Quite easy to never be satisfied and never all will not, because this process is endless. It is a process of endless fight for improving its status from peoples.<p><p>First, people want their own management system then its self-consciousness grows, and he wants his autonomy. Then he wants partial independence, and then the full ...</p><p>You're no worse than me know this by the example of the Kurdish people. The right of peoples to self-determination laid down a long time ago, we welcome it. But it's not about what they want the actors of this process and how they can negotiate and with whom to identify this.</p><p>For Russia, the issue is that today and tomorrow in the Northern Caucasus not to lose its significance as a State that is able to associate itself with the right forces at the right moment. For example, the same Ossetia is clearly seen, though we may on the example of the Kurds or any other peoples consider this. See: recognition of Ossetia, none do not dispute. Helped, but this momentum hung in the air.</p><p><strong>— And then what?</strong></p><p>Is I now see the process from the point of view of the Russian Government. What the sensations engendered it, say, Ossetians, any South Ossetians, though he lives in Los Angeles, even if in Tskhinvali or in Moscow. That this created? On the one hand, encouraged that a large State supports the growth of its subjectivity and the right to establish their own State, and it's a nice feeling.<p><p>But on the other hand, when this impulse dies away, there are doubts. I am not suggesting that they appeared in South Ossetia. Although maybe there, just like in DND, LNR. There is the same story. When this impulse, this support hang, people begin to feel that they have transferred part of his, including his emotional subjectivity under the auspices of the Russian Government, paid a price for it.</p><p>Political loyalty is a very large price, but actually it does not have any healthy economic prospects. Yes, and what's next? It was unclear. This changes the mood and can contribute to the perestraivaniju communicative relationships. Let's say Russia will be talk: we helped this nation, they are betrayed.<p><p>So now, in Russia many people think, for example, about the Bulgarians. And in Bulgaria say that Bulgaria is part of the EU, leads the policy associated with the European Union, and has resisted the pressure, exerted by the anti-Russian in it.</p><p>I say: ' so this is treachery '.

', after reading it, you realize that everything is documented, concerns and Rybinsk.</p><p>In early August, users of social networks have begun to spread damaging photos of Rybinsk viaduct, located in the city centre on the street Maxim Gorky. The photographs can be seen lying on the carriageway of the pieces of concrete.</p><p>Authorities responded instantly. Soon on the official website of the administration of the city of Rybinsk appeared disclaimer that ' message in the media about the destruction of the bridge over the River bird cherries did not correspond to reality. About this claim in the MBU ' Urban Management ' of Rybinsk. Management experts went to the site. They examined the bridge construction and concluded that the condition Bridge fears does not cause '.<p><p>Everything was as expected. Received signal is reported, ' that the alleged fall of plaster cannot serve as a basis for statements about the collapse of a bridge '.</p><p>Although plaster is known, not Golden Autumn leaves and the sky just so not strewed. However, it is much more serious.</p><p>Two major bridge in rybinsk. One bridge over the great Russian Volga River. And small-across the River bird cherry. Bridge across the Volga tried to repair five-seven years ago, but it was limited only to repair bridge coatings, structural overhaul was conducted. Every year allocated for kopecks, so that the Volga bridge is under constant repair. Despite the permanent state of repairs it is in pretty bad shape. To the naked eye can see bare valves and crack.</p><p>Before the viaduct stands road sign ' Limiting mass is 18 tons, according to the rules, ' prohibits the movement of all vehicles, as well as their compositions, if their actual weight exceeds the amount designated on the sign '. Probably, the figure is taken from the ceiling, because the weight of modern buses with passengers on 10 tons exceeds this figure. And naturally, some drivers who blatantly hunting do hook in the 20 kilometers, when you can slip in a straight line!<p><p>The bridge is a very serious. To make or remodel, you cannot contribute on three kopecks. When the State appear, as it occurs today in Cherepovets, embarking on the construction of the new bridge. In short, this requires a well thought-out system organization at the level of the city, at the scope level.</p><p>Any reasonable person, say, at the level of the head of the city must beat all the bells. Only one bridge across the whole town is in a State of disrepair. And not only will break the link across the Volga, but, God forbid, happens any terrible tragedy.</p><p>However, from the point of technical specialist, to give an answer about the State of the bridge, you must rely on some sort of conclusion. Initiate them, as a rule, should the town head, which gives a job or his Deputy, or pass in urban management, whose balance is the technical construction of the hanging. No conclusions yet, so talk about a dangerous condition is impossible.<p><p>And sorry! Hundreds of millions of rubles spent on little-needed (except for the head, which seems really imagines himself ' Lord of the Rings ' or maybe Nice is fed with these works, which somehow strangely performed with the purchase by a single contractor, zajavljajushhegosja alone on the pitch and taking it on maximum price) objects called ring avtorazvjazkami.</p><p>For example, introduced two and a half years ago, you could say, on the Ring Road overpass. In violation of all norms of urban safety standards and traffic regulations the city of Rybinsk organized here roundabout. On the ring just don't turn around. Trolleybuses go immediately on two lanes.<p><p>During peak hours the entire bridge constantly clogged with trucks and overpasses (whether they are one hundred percent in good condition) stopping is prohibited, as well as beneath them. Traffic jams occur due to the fact that the combined into one made equivalent roads of different classifications. Staying on this machine when, in addition to creating dynamic, additional static load on the bridge supports.</p><p>The very appearance of the ring road until the end. Before the construction or reconstruction of a linear object must pass a State examination of designs and estimates the object. The Administration has spent some two million roubles to an object that has not been gosjespertizu.</p><p>Or, for example, Voroshilov Street ring that already this year ' vbuhali ' on the order of 109 (!) millions of rubles. And the next year 42 million more are planned. More than 150 million of budget money for some kind of denouement, the usefulness of which many citizens do not understand!<p><p>But the bridge has no money!</p><p>To such question of squandering budgetary funds is added and part absurdity. ' Ministry ' recently wrote about another strange become history, related to OOo ' Firm ' ERM ' and the same with the State of rybinskih overpasses. We remind that only leads to an enterprise approach (municipal Road Sports Street) five years ago, in consultation with the TH rybinsk was refurbished and forces means firm ERM.</p><p>Like all need to be satisfied and happy. Administration hands entrepreneur has fulfilled its task to rebuild road infrastructure rybinsk. An entrepreneur can safely do business, including regularly pay good enough taxes to budgets of different levels of RF, providing work for about 250 people. But all that It is logical and correct, not to the administration of Rybinsk. The head of the Rybinsk decide that in the barn of the city, right at the gate of the businessman, which official might simply disliked due to personal reasons, need post weight control (note also the budget, i.e. money townspeople). (Can't find that where it would be more logical to arrange such a post before entering the collapsing bridge?)<p><p>And never mind that, in principle, according to the Ministry of transport of the Russian Federation from March 29, 2018 # 119 ' approving the procedure for weight and dimensional control of vehicles, including the order of the items weight and dimensional control vehicles ' (as well as prior to this order), the weight of the post, in principle, there may not be. And never mind that the post control is installed with technical violations that do not allow him jespluatirovat. Money, repeated, ' vbuhany ' and ' mastered ', and possibly personal ego chapter satisfied at the expense of ordinary rybincev.<p><p>But if you just dream up and imagine what if administration of Rybinsk to be more reasonable and, ceasing business ' nightmare ' to do their duties and, in principle, a good idea with weight fasting implement approaches to Volga bridge where the real need for weight paragraph? Thereby terminating this bacchanal with overloaded trucks, systematically depleting the strategic for Rybinsk object.</p><p>But it looks like it will remain a fantasy!

But no one removes the responsibility of local authorities for management and the most efficient use of the funds received.</p><p>But the current leadership of the city, it seems, are other tasks, the most important thing to them is ' master ' money and it is possible that is not without self-interest.</p><p>This year the city is literally ' screw up ' finances for the construction of roads, which are kind of like safely ' mastered ', but the appropriateness of certain spending looks doubtful, to put it mildly. In particular, a very interesting object called: ' the road to street Rastorguyev with the Organization ring movement in the area of the crossing of Voroshilov, Cherepanova, Surkov in urban district of the city of Rybinsk, Yaroslavl region '. Here, by the way, the link to tender for public procurement website. Everything seems nice, but raised a number of questions that we now ask. And their answers, you may have to search for competent authorities.<p><p>If you open the above link, and in the corresponding section of the download the first document opened very much curious. This document is called: ' opinion on the definition of validation of the estimated cost of the construction, reconstruction, overhaul of capital construction projects on an road down the street with the Organization Rastorguev circular movement in the area of intersection of streets Voroshilov, Cherepanova, Surkov in urban district of the city of Rybinsk, Yaroslavl region '. The conclusion, by the way, a positive.</p><p>Firstly, immediately clear whom this road needs. The applicants for examination is OOO ' Vikonda Development '.<p><p>Secondly, the length of a linear object does not exceed 700 metres, plus a ring itself.</p><p>Thirdly, the estimated cost of all three phases of this opinion is scheduled for the 4th quarter and the year 2017 stands at 109 285 240 rubles.</p><p>What do we have in August the year 2018? The price of the first and third stages becomes equal to 109 543 740 rubles Tender wins the only party and, of course, at the maximum price. The second phase, the value of which is 6 323 660 rubles in prison, has been postponed until next year. But somehow its value grows to 42 million roubles. (And somehow have confidence that it will win all the same the only party that on the first and third phase construction.)</p><p>It turns out that the ' ring ' is worth more than 150 million rubles. Can you imagine — 150 million roubles less than one kilometer of the road! In years gone by the blagoustraivalos order of 50 yards. Rybinsk, that there is no problem of roads in need of repair? Than thinks the head of the city, including the ' green ' light to such projects? There is a feeling that he is guided by its own interests, because nothing else comes to mind when you see this is not a reasonable expenditure.<p><p>Margaret Thatcher said: ' there is no any ' public ' money, only taxpayers ' money!

Another innovation is the abolition of free parking on Sunday. True, during the holidays to put your car, you can still be free.</p><p dir='ltr'>Basically we are talking about the streets within the Boulevard ring. In particular, the maximum fee of $20 per hour, and 380 installed on Tverskaya Street, Arbat, Patriarch's ponds, as well as Petrovka and Neglinnaya. In addition, raised rates on parking near Moscow-City (i.e. in this case near the third ring road).</p><p dir='ltr'>Generally speaking, increased tariffs and on many streets between Boulevard and garden ring. Not up to 380 rubles, of course, but also noticeably.</p><p dir='ltr'>It is not just about improving. For example, on many streets within the same Boulevard ring introduced so-called ' reduced 24-hour ' tariffs is 100 rubles per hour during the day, 80 rubles per hour at night. And on some streets (for example, on the lawn of the Spasskaya Street and cow's shaft) are differentiated tariffs, which have become cheaper than it was before December 2018 year.<p><p dir='ltr'>In any case, it is worth to consult the tariff before the trip to the parking fee did not become an unpleasant surprise. However, this rule is sufficiently universal and applicable not only in the above-mentioned case.</p><p dir='ltr'>It is clear that the increase in the price of whatever positive emotions not adds. It concerns and parking places.</p><p dir='ltr'>Obviously, we should look at the problem in a comprehensive manner. That lack of free space for car parking in the city centre is a problem — a fact which has long been well known. Radically solve it so that all was well, it is hardly possible. This recipe does not come up with so far in any metropolis in the world, Moscow is no exception.</p><p dir='ltr'>The only more-or-less effective method is a gradual increase in the cost of parking to sufficient to reduce the transportation burden. In this case, according to preliminary calculations, it is about 15-minute percentage reducing such a burden.<p><p dir='ltr'>Of course, this method is not the most pleasant. And hardly the city authorities would only to them, whether it be other reasonable alternatives.</p><p dir='ltr'>In addition, it is worth remembering about for people who do not come to work in the Centre of Moscow, and live here permanently. And such quite a lot.</p><p dir='ltr'>Following the introduction of paid parking in the Center for car owners living in the central areas of the capital, were introduced the so-called resident permit. Nebesplatnye too, it should be noted-3000 rubles a year for 24-hour parking. From 20.00 till 8.00 am you can park for free.</p><p dir='ltr'>But the resident permit is not an indulgence. That is, the holder has no possibility to require from another person remove machine only on the grounds that he lives in this House and right is here leave your car. The right has, of course, but what if all the seats are occupied, though and deep night in the backyard? Police and tow truck call? So don't come, because there are no reasons, since parking is paid.<p><p dir='ltr'>Again-any problem should be considered in an integrated manner. Parking tariffs is no exception.

And what about the inhabitants of other regions, the courts did not write off debts for the same reason?</strong></p><p>As pointed out by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the leadership of the NORTH in the middle of the year 2018, local people not only do not pay for officially received fuel, but also illegally connects to the pipe and stealing gas.</p><p>Accumulated over the years 2007-2015 duty for gas in the NORTH exceeded 53 billion rubles. In the year 2017 debt grew by 25% ($ 13 billion). And in 1 quarter of 2018-th is still almost 10 billion. ' Losses during transportation often absorb all that was actually just stolen — as a result of unauthorized connections or stub, and using various schemes of evasion, including fraudulent bankruptcy of enterprises of HOUSING and COMMUNAL SERVICES and jenergosbytov ', ""said Medvedev.<p><p>' Dilapidated network host which legally can be found, although in fact it is clear who controls absolutely inaccurate client base is advantageous primarily by intruders, that is those who in this earns. They are delaying the solution of these problems and have fueled corruption in this area ', concluded the Prime Minister.</p><p>Systematic non-payment of the population of Caucasian Republics (Ingushetia, Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia and Chechnya) and many years ' experience of their cancellation after such speeches, causes a double bewilderment. Federal authorities did not realize that they create a potential difference in a country that may spark give explosion?</p><p>Or they are so concerned about the loyalty of the republics of the Caucasus, especially Chechnya and therefore are afraid to bring order in the gas sector? But such indulgences, one at the expense of others (loss of Gazprom is the shortfall in taxes that will be taken, including) never lead to respect for the Caucasus. Caucasus respects the hard and just leader, rather than dobrenkogo and cowardly.<p><p>As the saying ' the truth. Ru ' <strong>senior fellow Russian Constantin Kazenin</strong> on Northern Caucasus debts arose largely because people individually do not pay for gas, but because over the years the debt of various companies including working partially, for legitimate reasons, was razmazan by population '. ' People often receive bills for nepotreblennyj gas is a common phenomenon in the Caucasus, ""the expert said. ' It is necessary to write off, in my opinion, this is the only option ', said Konstantin Kazenin. ' In Chechnya can be sources of problems any more. I hadn't heard, ""he added.</p><p>For its part, <strong>first Deputy Chairman of the Commission for the development of social infrastructure, local government and housing of the public Chamber of RUSSIA Artem Kiryanov said for ' truth. Ru '</strong>that, in the light of digitalization the economy in the coming years, the Government will be able to deal with non-payment, because ' in the North Caucasus republics very many things not at all not eligible. Electricity theft occurs, the illegal connection, tie-in various infrastructure '. ' It seems to me that this may be the last time in this mode are cancelled the debts ', said Artem Kiryanov.<p><p>And here is <strong>the Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma of minds on regional policy, the problems of the North and far East Nikolay Kharitonov </strong>believes that ' North Caucasus insufficiently secured jobs and people simply do not have the financial ability to pay for gas '. ' Maybe just some individual families, people, pay bills in a timely manner on gas, heat, electricity, commented mp ' truth. Roux '.</p><p>' Imagine that earnings in the Northern Caucasus, no. Where did the people go? To the Mujahedin in Afghanistan or Syria? So just be people competently explain — the Minister of energy Nowak, Minister of labour and Minister of topilin economy Oreshkinu to prevent people seethed with elsewhere, why 9 billion skostili Chechnya, for example, and other territories is no '.<p><p>' Show average salaries, conditions of life, work and much more. We have different territory, different climatic zones, different possibilities for life. If we want to drive the Caucasus to lysina, kerosene lamp, be cheap. But do we do? ', ""said Nikolai Haritonovju.</p><p>One might agree with Mr. Haritonovym, but in Russia, there is a practice of subsidizing the poor.

Writers-comedians-even more special interlayer. They talk to you seriously and you laugh and suddenly you see the whole situation he world around, its serious efforts, its far-reaching plans. Laughing, go from stupidity.</p><p>Comedians — gift for dusty and monotonous way. They are a miracle. Arkady Krumer — comedian. Very serious. Diplomatic.</p><p>Knows how to make friends is another separate talent. When writes is unclear, because he is always busy-festivals, concerts, projects of all kinds. But writes. And of this we decided to talk with him.</p><p><strong>— Dear Mr. Krumer, whence came this thrust invent fantasize, make laugh, entertain? Where and how did it all start?</strong></p><p>-Thrust came from Odessa. From Grandma's yard in Durinskom Lane, where every second was Zhvaneckim with the only difference that did not write their miniatures.</p><p>... Aunt Armor without hands, that was such a cool voitelnicej that for love tricks send to jail her lover of Belvedere, then thumbs up, bathed him again.<p><p>Yashka-zaika with whom we were drinking wine at wine basement, and then he offered to go to the putanam, but to know that I'm only ten, said: ' a, n, t-r-early, then p-Let's go to the next year, Sir! '</p><p>... Ivan Nikiforovich is a Russian man, who spoke in Yiddish the best of all in the yard, and nose him was more than all the Jews, although rumors of particular Jewish nose, without a doubt, too exaggerated ...!</p><p><strong>— There is such saying: writers — the last smart people on Earth. It is instead a compliment, though — the absolute truth. You want to comment on?</strong></p><p>Is apparently the author of this utterance was himself a writer. If he was a merchant or a plumber, definitely, would say that the last smart people on Earth — merchants or plumbing.</p><p><strong>-You like the 21st century and people in this century?</strong></p><p>Is True of men in General on Earth getting smaller, and it is a disastrous increase in population. Here is a paradox. Life in the twenty-first century so that it floats the turbulent flow of the man once say another good word, to lend a hand to someone, be good-natured, responsive.<p><p>When people are pushed in that thread, themselves relegated bad words. Good and evil won something previously only in fairy tales, and even now there is almost no such fairy tales. But I, of course, somewhat dramatize that picture came out more relief. It is famous for the reception, that sin is not only the people, blend all pro-life.</p><p><strong>— Who became the first reader of your literary text? That was behind the text, and it was the reader?</strong></p><p>— The first reader was a friend from third grade Stories. I wrote a verse. It sounded something like this: ' these hands hugged me in the quiet rustle of summer herbs, those lips I kissed, something loud prosheptav! '</p><p>Borka looked at me, then asked: ' is Pushkin, huh? '. I humbly was silent. In the future, I no longer receive compliments.<p><p>From his youth still remembered the text that I wrote for the youth theatre of satire. It was called ' a man amongst the people '. The plot was simple: to land with some wild planet where man Wolf and a boa constrictor, if you arrive a stranger to escape here. And faced with our reality, understand what on earth it OFC ...</p><p>And this was a time of rampant censorship. And here I was called-was invited to the regional leader, and he gently tells me: ' here's you, citizen Krumer, the stranger if you arrive directly in our Soviet GUM where it almost have trampled. Not good somehow!</p><p>We have man friend, Comrade and brother even when in the store give imported boots or vodka coupons, because the Soviet man is not, under any circumstances, loses its shape of the Builder of communism!</p><p>And let us better — let this stranger arrives directly to them, in their Pentagonskij the Department store! Can you imagine how truer then will plot?! ... '<p><p>And then I decided to let that stranger better never arrives, and sits on the wild planet. So it will be much safer for him and for me.</p><p><strong>-What was the first success? Do you remember the pain of failure? If this was of course. And is what he taught you?</strong></p><p>— Success do not remember, and failure was remembered, it was a resounding failure. I was invited to ' read funny stories in front of an interesting audience '. Sounded tempting and mysterious, and I agreed.</p><p>The Hall was packed. I played great klezmers. The audience clapped like mad, the Hall was abuzz. It was clear that the audience has gathered, which you can only dream of. So I came on the scene, crowded with optimism, especially as the story chose the funniest.</p><p>And here I'm starting to read — in reply dead silence! It lasted three minutes, although it seemed like an eternity! Then people started between a rustle, peresheptyvatsja candy wrappers and, finally, talk in full voice, walk or even doze off.<p><p>I'm a poluobmorochnom able to courageously read to the nearest point, and left the stage quietly, in English. The audience this tragic moment of my biography is generally not noticed and continued to entertain herself. And I was sitting in the dressing room, vigorously promising never again nose on stage don't poke.</p><p>And there banged in the dressing room the Tamara, which invited me to a concert, and a zataratorila that did not have time to warn that no one understands Russian, because they are all from America, the grandchildren of former Russian emigrants who lost their ancestral language. And that nothing she had failed. Do not remember exactly, I killed this Tamara or not. Although, if killed, I will justify any court ...</p><p><strong>The world reads your books. He is happy, laughs, thinking. What's a great tip you received for your text? What is sad?</strong></p><p>— I wouldn't round reading me till the sizes of the world though, if you believe the Internet and cannot believe him, my passbook sold in many countries where people speak the Russian language at home.<p><p>The most enjoyable review? I was told by acquaintances and strangers, that when the soul scratching my cats, they open the my book ' Izzy Katz and other Russians ' and cats become slowly and quietly begin to purr. If it is at least to some extent, but I'm not in vain maraju paper, ranging from letters to all sorts of words.</p><p><strong>— The combination in one person the writer and producer, is striving to make life look like a thriller? Oglushitelnost the world of show business and Cabinet quiet — how it fits?</strong></p><p>Life itself is like a thriller, even without the keyboard. It is given to a person, and it should be lived. It is carried, if it someone being chased. And melkanii want to see something important.</p><p>Life, she scolded critics, its terribly unhappy. Her love and hate. To life the rest concerning, arguing that this is not life. She often binds us hand and foot, or gives under the RESP, testing for durability.<p><p>But personally, I love life, even when it becomes unbearable. I, too, often unbearable, but my family and friends still doesn't stop me loving.</p><p>It turned out so well that I equally love to invent festivals and in the intervals between them play words, folding of them all sorts of stories — children and adults. For me this combination is a great luck!</p><p>In childhood, as well as all of the last century, wrote short words on fences, already realizing that brevity is the sister of talent. But this is not paid fees, and pour to the first number.</p><p>Therefore gradually switched to newspapers and magazines. Published in ' grakan ', ' newspaper Znamya yunosti ', ' Literary ' Russia and even in the famous ' Labour '; in the journals ' Youth ', ' Moscow ', ' Ural ' ...</p><p>But the Cabinet has never been quiet because there was no Cabinet. Where you wrote ... Here I would ask correctly put the accent. I used the corner and write yourself into thinking that all the same Nice to have in this life is your angle.<p><p><strong>-. What is the nature of humor and generally any texts, the atmosphere, the tasks of the theatre in Russia different from ours? From Israel? How was the spectacle that is put on your play in Smolensk drama Theater Griboedova?</strong></p><p>-If you withdraw from the challenges posed by ' Party and Government ', each theater they, apparently, their, regardless of geography. The main thing that has not disappeared from the theatre the theatre itself, its unusual atmosphere, where every day is played life. If there is an atmosphere of the theater, there are theater. In any country. Well, if left here paytraq.com! ...</p><p>Smolensky Theatre — a real survivor, it this year is 239 years. Almost anniversary. And I am terribly pleased that February 26, almost in the Jubilee year, premiere.</p><p>In the author's version of the comedy called ' Four in a bed, not counting the fifth ', in the theater is less specifically: ' love me, love '. But there is a fairly decent, and performance can see even children under sixteen.<p><p><strong>-You have changed over the years in our dramatic and hot country? Changed your themes, humor, sadness, goals, thinking and life?</strong></p><p>— A couple of years ago I was in Vitebsk and with a difference of one day accidentally met two ladies with whom once walked in one kindergarten. Long time since we have never met. And here is the first one told me: ' listen, you're generally not changed! '. And the second said: ' just chilling like you scared aged! '.</p><p>So now I can confidently say that has changed, and no! Country love it all and different, small and huge! There are lots of tinsel, a lot of noise, then Jews from around the world, looking at each other, do not believe that the Jews ... But the country is wonderful, its just gotta see!</p><p><strong>— As is the case with fools? You don't notice you shy away from them, you get along with them? ...</strong></p><p>-Fools in Israel case is very good! Them among the Jews was much more than expected! And maybe the thing that fools like to always be on his mind, guide the process.<p><p>But the fool in Israel is more than a fool, because, by connecting with local flavor, gives unpredictable results. Remember back in the Ulpan, one of our so was proud of his nationality, that is suitable for all queues and spoke passionately: ' I am a Jew, Jew, Jew! And you're a Jew?! '.</p><p>You know, fools, for whatever reason, multiply faster, while the Chinese are multiplying faster than anyone on Earth, but are not fools. There are exceptions to everything.</p><p>But seriously, I quite often when something lopuhnus, take a mirror and saying: ' well, fool you, Krumer! '</p><p><strong>-What piece of literature you delighted, delighted, outraged lately?</strong></p><p>— Happy book Leonid Finkelja ' be happy, be happy, Rome, Ashkelon! '.</p><p>I'm glad I'm in the circle of his friends. He's a wonderful writer and a wonderful person. Such combination, unfortunately, rare.<p><p><strong>— What makes a writer Arkady Krumer at leisure? Writes, thinks, watching talk shows, prepares delicious dishes?</strong></p><p>— Many of which do: write spirals all sorts of festivals, I love buying gifts, vygulivaju labradorshu Lady, though she believes that she walks me.</p><p>And sometimes I think Raven, spit into the ceiling, I wander to the flea market and am tying to find any beautiful nonsense, which, uniting with previously purchased becomes collection.</p><p>I collect figurines of klezmer music, clowns and even a lot of everything. All these I have decorated with balcony, living room, bedrooms and even rooms called comfort. And — to my position was clear — through the entire balcony hanging slogan ' Boss loves minimalism '.</p><p>The only thing that never do — do not watch talk shows. Consider them a crime against nature's Crown.</p><p>And delicious dishes I rarely Cook, or rather will say: do not cook ever! I mostly eat them with pleasure that gives pleasure those who prepares them.<p><p><strong>-' Slavianski Bazar ', the famous International Festival of the arts in Vitebsk, he for you? As enough forces on these major Israeli invasions? To gather such kinds of flowers in one bouquet? Than life in this direction, in this implementation you're particularly proud of?</strong></p><p>-The Festival is fun for me, a real celebration in the middle of the summer. I love Vitebsk is a town with a special energy. This year we will fly to the Festival in the twenty-third time. And if at first the Israelis ' Slavic Bazaar ' caused surprise, today it is difficult to imagine a Festival without us.</p><p>' Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk ' is a Festival without borders, where everyone knows each other because speak the same language, language arts, language of music.</p><p><strong>-At what journalistic question you especially nice would be the answer?</strong></p><p>Is it so happened that once the Union of Russian writers gave me an award named for ILF and Petrov book ' Majsy with side curls '. And at the end, when the ceremony was over, and people are already sold, ran an administrator and Deathly voice reported that all the books that I brought for exhibition, someone whisked. I'm terribly relieved and said, what about this turn of events everyone dreams the author.<p><p>So if any journalist asks: ' your passbook are so popular that they ever even stolen? ', I will be very happy to answer.</p><p><strong>Writers know about life a lot, give the Council: how us humans who did not become writers, become happy?</strong></p><p>— Sometimes to become happy, not enough to be a writer, although this is hardly an ideal formula of happiness. Well, if without jokes, great happiness on Earth a little and a little much. It just need to be able to discern. Learn to rejoice in simple things is, probably, and there is a real happiness.</p><p><strong>-. That you will never forgive?</strong></p><p>Is corny as it sounds, don't forgive betrayal of those from whom did not expect betrayal. Fortunately, I have a negative experience this is not great. Friends from past life remained friends. And new proved that they are friends. And I, in turn, try to not increase their negative experiences.<p><p><strong>— What the hell out of the character you in itself does not take what fight?</strong></p><p>I am a lifetime struggle with their weaknesses, and whole life they are winners. So humbled and accept them, trying to pass for dignity.</p><p><strong>-In a few words: he is a writer and a man of Arkady Krumer?</strong></p><p>I would be against him did not misuse the word ' writer '. He is a person who writes all sorts of texts. Sometimes they are good and funny, sometimes vice versa. Apparently, this had to say at the beginning of our conversation, but let down by my innate modesty.</p><p>And now to the point: he, i.e. citizen Krumer, is at an age when the results of the draw is still early, and take your mind too late. It is known that he tried through life not fooling around, not brains, swearing no puff.<p><p>And today with a pure heart to say that these efforts were completely vain! ... As a child he used to climb into other people's gardens, smoked around the corner and soundly lied. That is quite well developed.</p><p>It does have children, grandchildren, friends and is cautious assumption — has a head on his shoulders. Therefore, it is certain that he has almost everything ...</p><p><strong>-. What can you say about this world?</strong></p><p>— Too believe that this world already save cannot be. But you still need to save. Perhaps it is only a futile exercise that you should do.</p><p>***</p><p>Arkady Krumer, the author of the plays ' three hours on writing ' and ' Nonsense ' (co-authored with Michael Shulman), which were staged in State academic Theatre named after Yakub Kolas, Kharkov and the Almaty TJuZah, Mogilev theatre and others.</p><p>They have filmed two television movie.

So is our hero. He is a conductor, composer, actor, educator, arranger ... His irrepressible nature very accurately reflects the essence of the Israeli Opera is a young, fearless and dynamic ...</p><p>A few years ago, the country looked terribly witty and accurate parody-play in the center of which were Opera stamps, theme, funny situations from the world of Opera. All accomplished in a pool of blood (ketchup? beet juice?), Hall laughed — and Opera became everyone a little closer.</p><p>David Zebba — his name is. But everyone knows him very diminutive, an appropriate name — Doody in which you can hear something charmingly boyish. Informal and friendly. He is the head of the Opera Studio. And his gait-flight, and this is a boyish ' Doody ', and Opera-blockbuster for kids and adults on Carroll by ' Alice in Wonderland ' is all alive and rapid.</p><p>Holidays musicians and music lovers send each other funny greetings recorded Doody Zebboj with studijcami. His creative life spectrum there is no limit. He was always asked to make a choice to stay on something one is conducting, composition, theatre ... And he wanted to do everything, it caused all of us — and that's exactly what he was able to organize my life.<p><p><strong>-Mr Zebba, you are already a good number of years presiding over Israeli smithy Opera frames ...</strong></p><p>-... Yes, more than a dozen ...</p><p><strong>— Tell me, whether it was not such a case, when you do not accept the applicant, not heard, not looked at a singer, and he then shined at the major opera stages?</strong></p><p>-From 30 applicants we take two. Competition is high. And I love so when sits a large Commission. Then a more objective decision. All people are inherent errors. We cannot say that everything is always very accurately. But so far, unfortunately or fortunately, we have not made such errors.</p><p><strong>-What event, important, joyous, completed for you late?</strong></p><p>Together with our famous singer Rita I performed in Japan. For this concert were made entirely new arrangements. Rita is very talatlivyj, music man, immensely dedicated music creator, she knows a lot. And the Japanese public is appreciated.<p><p><strong>Is There such a moment: singer, singer, very nice, bright, but the time has come — and left voice. Sad, but true. And concert ticket still costs a fortune. And all though secretly gave the floor to praise: how would this singing is actually a pleasure.</strong></p><p>Trouble is, it's very sad. So put a star and we want to believe that she is with us forever. I was at a concert by Barbra Streisand in Jerusalem, it was an unusual night. The memory of a wonderful minutes that she gave for a while that we know it, the skill of actresses, the charm of personality — all of this created an atmosphere. But the voice was gone. And it's hard to take. The same thing happened many times. And this happens constantly. Time is a harsh thing.</p><p><strong>— You have been</strong> serve the Opera. Can know the secret of luck, mystery, which is hidden in the system of training in the approach to the material, in psychology, avoritete and skills teacher?<p><p>-Success is a Blue Bird, it's a very strange thing. The teacher is just part of a large road. Work ability, case is the magic keys. It seems to me that talent does not always give 100% guarantee. Life itself is a mystery, art is a mystery even more seriously.</p><p><strong>In Israel there is the audience for serious, high art or pop tops in queries?</strong></p><p>-Educate the public. Every day from the service entrance of the Opera. Opera goes to the people. Our members participate in performances. For them it is a priceless experience. And the public, which may not always arrive in Tel Aviv, a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>-From whom and what is the artistic level of the audience?</strong></p><p>— From the family. From friends. The level of theatres and orchestras. I, for example, recently sat exam on fotrepjano at the music school (konservatorione). First played 30 students who came in sandals and crumpled t-shirts. Then played 30 disciples who came to akkuratnenkih kostjumchikah, vyglazhennyh rubashechkah and shiny botinochkah. And attitude to music, to the instrument, the Commission was fundamentally different. I asked the Director why so. He replied that first thirty teachers name is Yitzik. And in the second half of the examined teachers name is Irena. Got it? One student called me ' Maestro ' is also from the family, from home, from cultural background.<p><p><strong>You, with your abilities for music, languages, probably already perfectly speak Russian?</strong></p><p>""Oh, I'd be happy ... But no, I only have a small vocabulary. And I really love and understand Russian expletives.</p><p><strong>Yes this whole layer.</strong></p><p>— And wise! Sometimes just not say otherwise!

How can I keep the authenticity of historic buildings, including the oldest? And that this is more important: antiquity, architectural merit, historic value or something else? And how all this can be combined in practice and to write in modernity? These and other questions <strong>' truth. En '</strong> the programme ' viewpoint ' responded<strong> the President of the National Fund for the rebirth of the Russian country estate ' ' and the Director of the Association of owners of historic farmsteads Alyavdin Vissarion.</strong></p><p><strong>— Vissarion Igorevich, most importantly in the preservation and revival of the estates? In Lermontov Museum in Moscow is a gorgeous building walls — vintage thick on the outside really all saved, but inside-the-walls and ballroom. Old building of MSU at Manezhke-also seems to resemble the original, historical, and actually is not quite what it was when the ground when studied</strong> all great minds. Why is done instead of the real conservation of such pastiche?<p><p>— And what else can be the solution? Just demolish buildings or leave, like the Parthenon and the Coliseum without a roof, because sooner or later the roof of prohuditsja and will need to change it? Imagine what would Moscow?</p><p>Faces fine new houses and Stalin built, which is still strong. And all that was built in the 19th century or early 20th century, stands without roofs, glass under some caps to longer such remained.</p><p>Now the same can go for Taganka. There is a street of Solzhenitsyn, the former Alekseevskaya, then she was called a Communist. You will see that with the two parties almost completely preserved merchant building. And it was such a good merchant district, beautiful mansions. In one restaurant, and the other is an art gallery, they in private circles. Of course, something has changed, but they correspond to that era, her spirit is maintained. Here's the most important thing.</p><p><strong>— Old</strong> Basmannaya — so too.<p><p>— Yes. You go almost entirely the same street as it was 100 or even 200 years ago. By the way, this is, unfortunately, a rare phenomenon in Moscow, in contrast to St. Petersburg. You go on these few streets and feel that you are in the atmosphere of the past.</p><p>Here you can easily imagine the plunge in history. The rest is a matter of your education in some sense, knowledge of the details of emotion. Someone is very expensive, someone still someone accustomed to hi-tech and live ready it completely, but someone still loves antiques, antiquing ...</p><p>So here, as they say, there is no accounting for tastes. But there has to be compromise in that architecture must be preserved, by typing in modernity. It is the usual story of architecture.</p><p><strong>— Question is that restoring? What is more important is the oldest or most important architectural, historical value? ...</strong></p><p>-The fact of the matter is that each epoch architecture, naturally, becomes the old Foundation. Sometimes in the truest sense. And in fine art too. Using the past, built new, and restructuring are sometimes worn, sometimes obstraivajut as the Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir is one of the oldest. He was little, and now around him have built large.<p><p>Here are a number of worthwhile Dmitrovsky Cathedral-as built and stayed. Church of the intercession on the NERL, as was well worth it. And here is the Assumption obstroili. But this is drawn up by the architects, historians, Museum staff is absolutely the right approach.</p><p>He is in finding a reasonable compromise beats between two poles: authenticity, maximum preservation of old and rationality, necessity of accounting capabilities. So taken and in Europe. In most cases, more interesting, more valuable to preserve the heritage of Rome, than pozdnevizantijskoe.</p><p>But this does not mean that we will carry pozdnevizantijskoe only on this site see the pit, the foundations of Roman buildings. Roman building we find there is in 20 metres, and it is not necessary to raze pozdnevizantijskoe. You should save and Roman, even if it remained only the foundations and the Byzantine Basilica.<p><p>With regard to the farmsteads, a decent portion of them is already a museums. They are famous for their specific owners, stroivshimi their architects or something. When the question is that we keep the estate as a Museum, as an object of cultural heritage, then this era and should be decisive.</p><p>When you create a Memorial Museum in memory of Suvorov, Tolstoy or block, cleaned a later alteration, if they can be removed. And remains closest to that era. Therefore, a complex of dissonance, some uncertainty on this issue.

As the Manor revived in Russia? And how not to let disappear deep Russia? Is it possible to self-financing estates?</p><p>These and other questions ' truth. ' replied Roux <strong>, President of the National Fund ' Rebirth of the Russian country estate ' and the Director of the Association of owners of historic farmsteads Alyavdin Vissarion</strong>.</p><p><strong>— Vissarion Igorevich as better, closer to the historical appearance of the preserve estates? Who should deal with? What you need to do and what not? categorically</strong></p><p>-Just needs to be professional and careful work of architects, historians, art historians, restorers and everyone else who is doing everything to be done properly, really was the historical truth and myth-not fiction. Without naming specifically, let me give you an example just wacky.</p><p>In the same Manor has long been dispute goes, periodically later: since home recreate everything correctly when it was made? ... It is always dangerous. Again start conversations that on old foundations it is not deployed, he was Grand here, well done vice versa. That House looks like, there is no dispute but only launched in the wrong direction. There are such incidents. This usually happens where we touch recreate.<p><p><strong>Even just walking through the city's old quarter is very interesting. If you were in such a constantly, then you get used to the different atmosphere. How now need it to society as a whole? Courtly culture in demand?</strong></p><p>— It's not even that interesting. Ancient Russian Homestead can still be Fatherland, how would the appeals it sounded. It is my deep conviction and, fortunately, the belief of many people that encounter this issue. It is clear that this is a wonderful cultural center, a wonderful opportunity to see aesthetics, not ruin and restored Manor House. This is Nice and everyone who lives nearby.<p><p>But there is still a very important point. In socio-economic terms, we are faced with enormous and extremely fast advancing rural territories degradation and their obezljudivaniem.</p><p>Even before those words were uttered by the President on the spatial development of Russia, we worked in this direction. I perfectly understand that immediately and simultaneously all these issues we cannot solve. So, alas, this theme and sounded just now, but well, that task now. I hope the necessary steps will be made, and they have already made.</p><p>Well, this should have been done in 70-ies of XX century, rather than the so-called optimization of rural settlements, when for the sake of perspective were destroyed hundreds of thousands of so-called dead-end villages. People were rounded up in the larger settlements. And now we see how these large degrade right before your eyes.</p><p>So, we are looking for those jakorki in the space of our huge State with no very large populations. My colleagues and I are not getting out of trips to Russia, especially those estate. Visited central part, Northwest, South, Povolzhye, Urals, to a lesser extent. I see two or three on the bow.<p><p>First, of course, is a modern economic production, so to speak, industrial, and agricultural processing large farms, some other workshops, etc.</p><p>The second is the monasteries and monastic farmstead. If there is a monastery in the locality, you can cross, glory to thee, o Lord, that this locality will live. Because pilgrims come and Coun. Part of living in a monastery, part is about. Work is under way. Even the deaf places arise these farms and farms.</p><p>And the third such museums are jakorkom-estate. Homestead museums keep on not only the cultural and historical as we used to understand, but also social function now. There are, for example, the locality of Hmelita in the Smolensk region, there beautiful manor, griboedovskaja, you might say. There's been this House Griboedov, belonged to his relative. That's where a magnificent Museum.<p><p>But this Hmelity neighborhood have long ceased to be alive if there at the end of 80-ies would not have decided to open a museum already became extinct Griboedova all this. But now people have jobs. Young has little but valuable top notch work rates of Museum staff. Retired people work there permanently. Naturally, security, cooks, chauffeurs, administrative staff, etc. It's long been a private Manor. And each of our Association members estates creates jobs in the outback.</p><p>Some restoration has been completed, there are museums. There is a Manor, which continue to restore. It is the center of growth or at least maintaining optimum population. So this function of cultural heritage even cannot be overemphasized.</p><p>And most ... We often talk about internal and entry tourism, and in Russia, there is something to view. Our Church culture is unique, original and any representative of other countries is interesting. Kremlej we have a few, but there are ' zolotoe kol'co ', there is the Church, primarily, but also the architecture of the manor could be.<p><p>Because that's where the whole genotype of Russian culture, its originality. All the best writers were born, grew up, lived and worked in the houses. Almost all composers, poets, scientists, military leaders, their life and work were associated with mansions, even when they worked in capitals or far from home.</p><p><strong>-Self-financing farmsteads possible?</strong></p><p>— Hard. Get off at self-financing is very difficult. To date, we have only a few farmsteads themselves fed and provide. Then there are people finally have established work that may themselves contain. But that return costs of restoration, saying not yet accounted for. I think it's going to happen is still very soon.</p><p>Therefore, these people are real volunteers preserve cultural heritage. It's really only volunteers with the money that chose to invest not in business to make a lot of money, not a yacht in any superokeanskuju not in any cottage once and decided to invest in our common cultural heritage with you.<p><p><strong>Conversed Said Gafurov</strong></p><p><strong>The publication was prepared by Yuri Kondratiev</strong></p><p><strong>Read also:</strong></p><p>The revival of the Manor — the salvation of Russia</p><p>Manor new age has arrived?</p><p>Monument of architecture without owners cannot live</p><p>What is the principle buildings recognize the historical</p><p>Embed the ' Truth.

  David Shneyderov: prohibition of other cultures-catastrophic folly",david-shneyderov-prohibition-of-other-cultures-catastrophic-folly,,"<p class='lead'>Only last year, Ukrainian State film agency banned 139 Russian films and serials. Among them are many modern movies and even cult Soviet ribbons — ' twist of fate ', ' kavkazskaya plennica ' and ' Moscow does not believe in tears '.</p><p>But ban films, tv series and books is doomed to failure and has the opposite effect in the era of advanced Internet, said in an interview with ' the truth. Roux ' <strong>film critic and television presenter David Shneyderov</strong>.</p><p>Such a policy by the authorities of Ukraine is the Foundation of Ukrainian nationalism. It should be noted that the Russian psevdopatriotizm the entire American denial is such a phenomenon that cannot be welcomed. Culture should unite and not divide people, believes the film critic. The cultural roots of the Russians and Ukrainians are the same. You can call Dostoevsky a Ukrainian, but he does not cease to be a Russian writer.</p><p>Even now in Ukraine there operate Russian filmmakers, they shoot series and Ukrainian officials on the ground is quite loyal to their work. The same mood and the people. Russian cultural figures, according to David Shneyderova, have a different perspective on the events in Ukraine — from calls to send in the tanks ' Kiev ' to ' bring back Ukraine Crimea '. This shows that the question of friendship and hatred of Russians and Ukrainians is far from being resolved.<p><p><strong>— David, over the past four years, Ukraine has banned the showing on its territory, many Russian films, for example, ' the legend of no. 17 ', ' night watch ', ' the day watch (Dnevnoy Dozor) Timur Bekmambetov's ' and other movies. Recently there was even a formal protest to the Ukrainian authorities over the rolled in United States movie ' t-34 '.</strong></p><p>-Add more to this list ' ironic ', ' the irony of fate. Continue Reading ', ' Bitter! 2 ', ' Kitchen ' in Paris and so on only about 200 films there is already prohibited.</p><p><strong>Although it seems to be no policy here. The film may prohibit even because there are playing any artists, where the current authorities</strong> consider to be their enemies and unacceptable odious personalities. For Example, Natalya Varley, Oleg Tabakov ...<p><p>— Sergey Bezrukov, Mihail Porechenkov ...</p><p><strong>-Ivan Ohlobystin, etc.</strong></p><p>— With some I understand the situation. Porechenkov, for example. The catastrophic stupidity — to open fire with live ammunition in the side of the Ukrainian military. It is categorical nonsense. Although it seems to me that in principle, all huge problems that exist between our States, such bans is even greater nonsense.</p><p>I would carefully used the word ' Ukraine ', although understandable, that usually means it's still government leadership of Ukraine. It seems to me that this is almost the same as in Russia: a guide is one thing and the people is another. I'm also convinced that any prohibition of the culture somehow aimed at inciting ethnic hatred.</p><p>And this is, among other things, prohibited by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, as well as the Ukrainian Penal Code and the Constitution. Culture should bring, culture is an occasion to make each other's faces problems, understand each other and solve these problems.<p><p>When its time bickering broke out between Russia and the United States and American artists have refused to come to Russia in absolutely politically motivated, I am extremely negodoval because I felt that in such a situation, it is particularly important to their arrival to Russia and communication with the media ...</p><p>Agree that if Russia would came Hollywood star, and newspapers and television and radio, and print media, and Internet media, and others. This would be for this star reason to express their opinions. Culture and sports must bring people. Ban Ukrainian athletes arriving in Russia at competitions is nonsense.</p><p><strong>Is Not on our side, naturally.</strong></p><p>— Not with ours. Ban Ukrainian athletes coming to Russia is a konchenaja stupidity of the Ukrainian authorities. Guys prepared, trained, had hoped to show results ... They are professional athletes. They earn on your future life, including their children. To deprive them of this possibility is awful.<p><p>The same fully applies to the various types of culture and art. Still too alive Association ... Because Ukraine is prohibited not only movies, but also books, and much more.</p><p><strong>— Monuments destroyed etc. Now in Odessa, for example, raises the issue of demolition of the monument to Catherine II. But still, in your opinion, what is the reason begets such a stupid decision?</strong></p><p>-To my mind, the reason is that the Ukrainian leadership, conscious of the fragility of the situation, particularly in the run-up to the elections, puts on nationalism. It's a win-win. Although it is, alas, a bet on bandits, stormtroopers, ultras, this rate of violence, incitement to hatred on the grounds of lzhepatriotizma.</p><p>I sometimes wonder how we with Ukraine are similar. Ukraine fanning hatred against To us. We are fanning hatred toward America. We often do the same, only more accurate. Because after all, firstly, this is not the case for culture in any way. We have shows American movies, American artists come to us. And, fortunately, our leadership enough crazy not to do it, but rather to invite Americans to Russia.

It is not just about the return of the treasures, and on the recognition of the legitimacy of the reunification of Russia and Ukraine.</strong></p><p>The Dutch newspaper Trouw phoned in the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, which, according to the Press Secretary, took a neutral position, and the collection somewhere ' secret, safely and responsibly is stored '.</p><p>It should be reminded that ' Scythian gold ' is a collection of artifacts from more than two thousand items valued at 2 million dollars, derived from 4-th Crimean museums. In 2014, they were used for decoration of exhibition in Allard Pierson Museum. At this time the Crimean reunification with Russia, and in the Museum feared that the selection of one of the parties to return a collection of Russia or Ukraine, will lead to serious claims to the Museum. Leadership does not want to take such a risk and decided to refer the case to the Court, explained Trouw.<p><p>In December 2016 year Amsterdam District Court on the basis of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on cultural heritage year decided to return the jewels of Ukraine — as a State which transferred the gold in the Amsterdam Museum. In may 2017 years museums in Crimea, where the exhibits, appealed the Court's decision. ' There is no legal, cultural or historical reasons to pass objects in Kiev. Objects are an integral part of the collection, which lovingly collected over the years dedicated archaeologists ',-said in a statement.

' The reason why it is so important for Ukraine is that awaited judicial recognition of the illegality of the annexation. And that the judge in the Western European constitutional State will decide on the matter '. ' It may seem like a foregone conclusion because of the UNESCO Convention, ""added van den Berg. ' But you should never underestimate your counterparty '.</p><p>As the saying ' the truth.

But for the exposure time was replaced by the owner of the cultural values of the territory, which is a Museum, has moved to another State. Usually when this happens, decoration and we were supposed to conclude an appropriate agreement with Ukraine. Here it was not, and it is understandable why the issue is politicized, the expert said.<p><p>Western courts, he said, as a rule, does not address the issue of recognition or non-recognition of international legal acts. In this case, the referendum in Crimea and Russia's reunification with Crimea, but the Netherlands, like other EU Member States did not recognize these acts legally. ' Therefore, if he is honest and right, should refrain from addressing the issue who return, ""he said.</p><p>' They (judges) realize that if they will give collection of Ukraine, there is a dispute between Russia and the Netherlands. We consider that the decision of the Dutch courts ignore our public law, in this case, the right to property and cultural values, which is a serious violation of the sovereign rights of the Russian Federation. This problem is then the basis of complications of relationships and so forth, ""the lawyer said.<p><p>The challenge, according to Anatoly Kapustina, Dutch Justice ' almost ' impasse.

  Path of Islam: Sunnis and Shiites",path-of-islam-sunnis-and-shiites,https://img.pravda.ru/image/article/7/1/6/400716.jpeg,"<p class='lead'><strong>Separation of Shiite and Sunni Muslims dates back to the early history of Islam. Immediately after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century a dispute arose as to who should lead the Muslim community caliphal. Part of the faithful has advocated elected Caliphs and other beloved son-in-law rights-Muhammad Ali Ibn Abu Talib. So for the first time was divided(shared) into Islam.</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>It was a direct Testament prophet, according to which his successor was to be Ali, but as is often the case, the authority of Muhammad, unswerving in life after death has not played a decisive role. Supporters of wills felt that lead the Ummah (community) have ' appointed by God ' Imams-Ali and his descendants by Fatimah, and believed that the power of Ali and his heirs — from God. Supporters of Ali known as Shiites, which literally means ' supporters, adherents '.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Their opponents argued that neither the Quran nor the second important Sunnah (supplementing the Koran set of rules and practices, based on examples from the life of Mohammed, his actions, statements in the form in which they are handed over to his companions) said nothing about the imamah and about divine rights to power sort of Ali. Didn't say anything about it and the Prophet himself. The Shiites responded that prescriptions Prophet construed — but only those who has the special right. Opponents believed these views heretical and said that should perceive the Sunnah, as it amounted to the companions of the Prophet, without any changes and interpretations. This line of supporters of strict adherence to the Sunnah became known as ' Sunni '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In the year 632, just two years after his election, Caliph Abu Bakr died, appointing his successor Umar Ibn Khattab. Over 12 years, in the year 644, Umar was assassinated in Medina, and he was succeeded by Uthman Ibn Affan from influential Arab kind of the Umayyads. After 12 years, in the year 656, and he was killed, and the fourth Caliph chose the Ali. But the ruler of Syria and a relative of Umar Muaviya accused Ali of involvement in the murder of the former Caliph, he was supported by noble birth the young Empire. Began a long civil war and dissension of the Caliphate. In 661 year Ali stabbed poisoned dagger in the mosque of Kufa.<p><p><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Mawlid al-Nabi-Prophet's birthday</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>After the death of Ali power captured Mu'awiyah. He signed a peace treaty with the son of Ali, Imam Hassan, which after his death, the power was supposed to go to Hassan. After a few years a Hasan died and the new Imam became his younger brother Husayn. And in 680 year Mu'awiyah died. He handed the throne to his son Jazidu, cancelling elective Caliphs and turning the Institute into the usual hereditary monarchy. Imam Husain did not recognise the authority of Yazid. The standoff didn't last long and ended in disaster for Hussein and his supporters. In the same year, 10 October 680, he with his family and closest supporters after a grueling siege was attacked in Karbala (Iraq) troops under the command of Caliph Ali, a former supporter of some Shimra. In this battle himself was killed by Hussein, his two sons, including a six-month baby, several relatives and almost all supporters.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In Karbala massacre outraged the entire Ummah. But for Shia Imam Husayn became a martyr for the faith and the most revered Imam. The city of Karbala, where Imam is buried, is considered the most sacred place for Shiites after Mecca and Medina. Every year Shia Revere his memory during the funeral ceremonies of Ashura. Known for shocking custom ' around ' world. The streets pass funeral processions, men who participate under your fraction in sign of mourning beat themselves with chains. Scars and wounds from that, considered as a sign of religious piety. Dressed in black women stand along the road, golosjat and beating their breasts. In old Iran decided to carry through the streets of the stuffed lion. Powered by actor, the scarecrow occasionally awkward movement of zagrebalo straw and sypalo it on his head, symbolizing the desolate nation posypajushhuju the head ashes. However, from the point of view of European, while falling very comic effect.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In Iran in the days of Ashura in the squares are still tazije is a unique religious mysteries, dedicated to both the death of Imam Hussein, and before her events. This tradition over thousands of years, and tazije became the same national symbol for Iran as Kabuki is Japan. Each character relies not changing centuries of costume and image. Imam Hussein dressed in green is the symbol of Holiness, as well as other ' Saints ' heroes, and his face closed a coverlet. The main negative hero Shimr dressed in red is a symbol of death and betrayal. In tazije actor is not playing, and ' depicts ' the hero. This is not the actor's performance, and work for the glory of God, and the glory of departed Saints. That is why the actor who plays Shimra may go mysteries curse his character's villainy and complain that he has to play such a terrible role.<p><p><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Night: Hijrah from Mecca to Medina</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Eugene Bertels wrote in his book ' Persian Theatre ', ' significant difficulty is to find actors for the role of villains. The audience already ceases to distinguish where theatrical action, and where daily, and intervenes in the idea, wanting to give a new turn to historical events. From the performers some roles have very tight, often they are beaten to the point that at the end of the events they have for a long time otlezhivatsja. Anticipating such a sad outcome, they try to prevent it and try to play less realistic, interrupting the speech of different uttering exclamations and curses his own villainy. But it's a little helps accumulated energy in the Hall looking for exodus and, in the absence of other object, unwittingly falls upon the hapless lobsters and Shimrov '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>With the death of Imam Hussein Institute of imams did not disappear. His son Zayn al Abidin escaped during the massacre at Karbala, recognized the power of the Umayyads and continued the dynasty. The imams had no political power, but have enormous spiritual influence on Shiites. Last, the eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari died in 873, and ' Muslim Megovingi ' ceased to exist. According to Shiite tradition, Hassan remained the son of Muhammad, ' twelfth Imam ', who at the age of five has been hidden by God and still exists. This hidden Imam must appear as the Messiah (Mahdi), his return part of the Shia (the so-called dvunadesjatniki) still awaits. The Imam of the people called Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian revolution of 1979 year establish theocratic Shiite regime in the country.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Sunni Shi'a understanding features of Imam as a mediator between God and man is a heresy, since they hold the concept of direct worship Allah, without intermediaries. Imam — from their point of view, an ordinary religious figure, has earned credibility of theological knowledge, head of the mosque, and the Institute for clergy they deprived the Mystic Halo. Sunnis Revere first four ' righteous Caliphs ' and do not recognize Ali dynasty. Shias acknowledge only Ali. Shiites revere the sayings of imams along with the Qur'an and Sunnah.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Differences persist and in the interpretation of the Sunnis and Shiites of Sharia (Islamic law). For example, Shiites do not adhere to Sunni rule considered divorce held since its proclamation by the husband. In turn, the Sunnis do not accept Shiite practice of temporary marriage.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In today's world the Sunnis make up the majority of Muslims, Shiites — a little more than 10 percent. Shiite Muslims are common in Iran, Azerbaijan, parts of Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan and in Arab countries (with the exception of North Africa). The main Shiite State and spiritual center of this direction of Islam is Iran.<p><p><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Muslim women demanding sex-heaven on Earth</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Conflicts between Shiites and Sunnis still occur, but nowadays they are often political in nature. With rare exceptions (Azerbaijan, Iran, Syria) countries, Shi'ite, all political and economic power is exercised by the Sunnis. Shiites feel aggrieved, their discontent is enjoyed by radical Islamic groups, Iran and Western countries have long mastered the science release Muslims and support radical Islam for the sake of ' democracy '. Shiites actively struggled for power in Lebanon, and last year rebelled in Bahrain to protest the usurpation of the Sunni minority political power and oil revenues.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In Iraq after United States military intervention the Shiites came to power, the country's civil war broke out between them and the previous owners — Sunnis and secular regime gave way to obscurantism. In Syria the opposite situation, where power belongs to the alavitam, one of the directions of Shiism. Under the pretext of fighting Shiite dominance at the end of the 70-ies of the terrorist group ' brothers ' unleashed a war against the ruling regime in the year 1982, the rebels captured the town of Hama.

But without economic growth and enhancing social orientation is not achievable. And neither we do not see. How much power do not adjust statistics by wishful thinking, no fool will believe your tv, if receiving became less, and prices increased.</p><p>The poor can be attributed to 70 per cent of households. After taxes, utility payments, interest on loans and mortgages, pay for rented accommodation, many families have income less than the poverty level. And if a family has children, the situation is getting worse.</p><p>On this and many other ' truth. ' Roux told <strong>the head of the Center for political economy Research Institute of the new society Vasily Moved.</strong></p><p><strong>-Vasily georgievich, officially in Russia nine million poor, although Putin once called figure of 20 million people, there are other evaluation. Why</strong> such a difference? <strong>How many in Russia still really poor people?</strong><p><p>— Just another thought — and all. Someone separately considered, did not take into account any Rosstat's data, for example, or economic and financial structures, and all have picked up, counted and said: ' and the poor here are so many ' — to them quite a bit of it. And other times simply decided that let their will be 20 million. And then say that this number has dropped as much as half.</p><p>Generally, even if their methods considered, but all bear 40 million. But really the poor can be attributed to 70 per cent of households.</p><p><strong>-A lot of work. Perhaps still less? After all, many have any extra income, which is not claimed. Although, of course, and not all costs are taken into account. And in any case poor we really very much. In America, in Europe an average of 30 percent, according to their methods of counting. It is clear that it is too</strong> A lot...<p><p>-And there, too, underestimate. Anywhere underestimate. It is only our Westerners like to say that there are all so wonderful and honestly. I have five and a half years spent in Greece, studying their crisis and European Union policy, compared, for example, Eurostat data that I just see and I know myself from people.</p><p>Eurostat published data, the average salary in Greece was 600 or 700 euros, and people say that more than 400 are not usually gets none. This is after the crisis, after all the austerity measures so it became. Before the crisis, the situation was quite different. So all these official data and real people's lives diverge very much everywhere. And everywhere are coming up with all sorts of brutal taxes, especially in the South.</p><p><strong>— What are the mechanisms for poverty reduction? Whether its really reduce twice, as planned by nacproektu? What should I do?</strong></p><p>There are two ways in which you can reduce poverty. The first is simply to reduce and cancel the taxes not withheld minimum taxes for people, including not to take VAT from all municipal systems. Even if we do not take 13 percent minimum income tax received by the fact he is added to the salary. And increases the minimum rate of pay.<p><p>You can enter an hourly rate of pay and leave people money, IE not izymaet households money, but leave them in their possession. It immediately increase the level of prosperity of the family simply because people do not lose the money. You can return the VAT when you buy any socially significant goods.</p><p>Could it be that these measures are not very real with us today. But the tax-free minimum is in China and in other countries. This is the first step towards the progressive income tax.</p><p><strong>— That is, the person who gets the 10-15 thousand rubles, is exempt from income tax?</strong></p><p>— Of course! What is income? ... He actually spends all this money exclusively on consumption. He, if any remain, then it insurance as a small parachute in case someone without work will remain in the family. And someone needs to cover a mortgage or a loan for a car.<p><p><strong>— If a man brings a certificate that pays the mortgage, probably, it is also necessary to take into account?</strong></p><p>— It seems to me that Yes. There are other measures. One of them, Vladimir Putin voiced (and it seems to me that this is the right initiative): do not take tax on families when they sell an apartment.

  Eve of Lent: repentance without intermediaries",eve-of-lent-repentance-without-intermediaries,https://img.pravda.ru/image/article/0/6/4/400064.jpeg,"<p class='lead'><strong>Closer and closer, lent is a time for memories of their sins and repentance. Soon the temples line up long queue wanting to repent. But it may be easier to ' confess directly to God '? Does repentance must be the witness? Can I repent of sin and receive forgiveness for not coming to church and not revealing the soul of a priest?</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Confession for Christian vocerkovlennogo is a usual thing. If you have experience of the Christian life, if you come up to communion often enough, that repentance before the lectern becomes something quite natural. And something of the same fit as regular examination by a doctor. Except that the doctor may find you completely healthy, and at confession, whether it arbitrarily frequent, necessarily be recalled any sin.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>But if the Christian-novonachalnyj or coming to the doorstep of the Church, or simply not very educated and ' scientifically ' in theological themes, the confession may cause he has many doubts and puzzlement. One of the most popular questions that are frequently asked by never visited at confession, but consider themselves faithful people is ' Why go to confession? After all, I can confess myself at home, directly to God '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Just why the experience of the Church from its earliest days was not in favour of those who adopt ' one on one ' with the Lord. Still Holy Apostles wrote that Christians should open sins to one another, rather than in secret prayer. ' Confess to each other before in misconduct and pray for each other to heal: a lot can reinforced the prayer of the righteous ', wrote in his message the Apostle Jacob, placing the prayerful intercession of Christians for each other above the possibilities of ' talk ' with God alone.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Eve of Lent:</strong> The last judgment — court of mercy?<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>But it is not only the common prayer. There is another reason why the confession ' God ' may be directly if not quite useless for the soul, it is much less useful than it could. And may, alas, and harm the cause.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>What is usually meant by confession ' directly to God '? Good even if it's really getting up on her knees and penitential prayer. Even better — if you have a prayer of the prayer book, where are ' average ' sins without details (than they are comfortable, go for these lines, as in sanochkah, given that everything is written in Church Slavonic, and go figure, that this language means some msheloimstvo) are added to the enumeration of sins and their sincere genuine repentance in them.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Well, if it really appeal to Creator and tears in front of him. In such a There is a penitential prayer and meaning and sense. In the end, daily confession ' alone with God ' downright prescribed by Christian, and in the daily prayer ' rule ' is present.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>But often we are talking about something else, and the ' confession ' is limited to ugryzeniem God right conscience and reluctant recognition of itself, that seems to have been wrong. And no way out beyond your own ' I ' does not exist in principle. God in this ' confession ' is understood as ' default ' — he saw that I'm liking about something perfect pity, I repented before him. Although the man of God has not approached Him about anything not prayed.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>No communication between two personalities at the same time, no desire for God, accessed on forgiveness and assistance in this ' prayer ' no. And according to the ' confessor ' God is obliged to listen sensitively to every movement of the soul, even if this motion is not at all in his side, and so ... in itself imagine ... and brought remorse, though it was one skolznuvshej thought ' somehow I entered wrong '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>But the purpose of confession and repentance is not a statement of fact ' I was wrong '. Actually, this is only the first step to repentance, but not his goal. A true repentance, designated the Greek word ' metanoja '-' change of thoughts ', it is a rebirth, a reunion with God, adhesion unity with him, broken by sin. No wonder says that you should ' bring the fruit of repentance '-a recognition of sin and even rejection from him is not enough, you should do something positive, actively show their change.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>But even in those cases where prayer is from the soul, heart, with tears and appeals to God, and desire to be reborn, danger can not pass. The fact of the matter is that praying in the void is very difficult. Pray, keeping mind of views ' personally ' his interlocutor is very hard. Prayer, while focusing on yourself — in his soul, in his sins — and not the originator of the ' image of God ' within itself, to which this same prayer and begins to treat is very, very high prayer.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Ability to not relegate God to some clip art is a difficult skill, not everyone is taken (and certainly not right away). But such samosotvorennyj ' image of God in the soul ' is not safe. This is not a visible icon on which you can settle your gaze, referring to the Prototype. Evil begins when this generated inside the mental image is starting to revive. The charm (i.e. spiritual) you can get, and not seeing reality descending from heaven, Angels and the Lord himself in the flesh. Trick yourself, you can very slowly, allowing established yourself picture replace someone who Only has to take confession.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>What is God is ' something '</strong> or Personality?<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Appears tempted to believe in the picture inside. Refer to Christ, Which imagined in his heart. And let it clean and Lick It shines like the Sun, and robes — whiter than white snow, but a genuine Christ imaginary picture. But he didn't understand as you confess is not God. How did — before imagined. And wait for a specific reaction of an imaginary interlocutor. And adjust themselves to it. Depending on the severity of the sin, the depth of knowledge of God, and just your own mood. And then one day you will be ' forgiven ', another your sins will remain with you. The only God there is nothing to do with it.</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Depending on the mood of the ' forgive ' or ' blame ' yourself so tempting. And many attribute to God your thoughts, not even requesting it, that is, merely deciding for the Lord. ' I realized that was wrong (as an option: I could not differently, I was weak) — and he forgave me '. Or vice versa: ' I have such terrible sinner that God does not hear me and there is no forgiveness for me forever '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Yes, the Church lectern we too ispoveduemsja God, not the priest. But here, firstly, there is a hearing person with vast experience on interviews — that is, the danger of falling into the dreams of varying degrees of masochism and selfishness still much smaller. Secondly, the priest is a man, actually (by the grace of the priesthood) has the right to declare the remission of sins and put the point where ' ispovedujushhijsja ' directly will be long-predolgo dig in yourself, majas remorse. Or vice versa: strictly say that simple recognition of sin is not enough. And, thirdly, by the word of the Apostle James — a priest is a witness of penance and prayer for the penitent. The presence of the priest confirms the firmness of our decision to renounce sin and willingness to testify is before God and the people.<p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Sometimes you can hear absolutely childish objection — I am too embarrassed to confess ' Mall before a priest, I have better directly to God '. But this phrase in the first place shows that England completely failed to understand what he is talking about. Is it logical to shy person, the same sinful and earthly, as you yourself, but boldly stand before God and not embarrassed in front of his face?</p><p style='text-align: justify;' align='JUSTIFY'>Need to go to confession as Traumatology as a doctor we go, undeterred by the most terrible and ugly wounds and not engaging in self. With the same sense should be resorted to and the altar table to heal izjazvlennuju sin the soul. No wonder the priest starting at confession, said came to him: ' hear UBS, because Bo came in vrachebnicu WAST, yes not neiscelen otydeshi ...

  Ash Wednesday-the gates of repentance",ash-wednesday-the-gates-of-repentance,https://img.pravda.ru/image/article/0/6/7/400067.jpeg,"<p class='lead'><strong>Today is the beginning of lent in the Catholic Church, Anglicans and some Protestant churches. This day Western Christians is called Ash Wednesday and is similar to the Orthodox Clean Monday. According to ancient tradition, Western believers, which have been on the path for Easter, keep strict fasting and ashes applied to the forehead the sign of the cross.</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>For Christians throughout the world — the period of lent and sad, and its light. People would wake up from hibernation, sinful depart from the everyday hustle and bustle, was routine. Devote more time to prayer, communion with God and reflect on his life.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Go directly from the routine to the quiet days of lent. So almost every Christian tradition there is a kind of transitional period, iconic, symbolic days indicate preparation for great lent and it started.</p><p style='text-align: style=''></p style='text-align:> justify; ' > Today is one of those days. Ash Wednesday, the first day of fasting for Christians of the Western tradition. This day exists not only in the calendar of the Catholic Church, but also to Anglicans and in many Protestant communities (in particular, the Lutherans). The first day of lent, Catholics — analogue Pure Monday in the Orthodox Church. The date of Ash Wednesday firmly tied to the date of Easter and to 45 days from her behind. Precedes Ash Wednesday the so-called ' Fat Tuesday ' last day ' magic spell and carnivals. Better, albeit less known name-' Repent ' day.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>On Ash Wednesday, the Catholic Church recommends strict post-same as on good Friday. In General, modern Catholic Church fasting and dietary restriction are not synonyms. Under fasting refers in the first place particular focus on internal spiritual life, repentant thoughts, prayer, reading Scripture, deeds of mercy. This does is not incompatible with an ancient tradition; as wrote St. John Chrysostom in the fourth century, ' is wrong whoever believes that post only in abstinence from food. True there are deletion post from evil, curbing language, deposition of anger, Taming the lusts, stopping slander, lies and kljatvoprestuplenija '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>But, contrary to popular belief about Oblivion food restrictions in ' liberal ' Western Christianity, in accordance with the precepts of the Catholic Church, every Friday, except the big church holidays, eat the meat is not recommended. This applies to Ash Wednesday; and even lean meal you can eat only once per day.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Eve of Lent: the last judgment-Court grace?</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The name ' Ash Wednesday ' speaks for itself. The mention of the ashes is not accidental and not only symbolic — according to tradition, this day is or sprinkle ashes on his head, or ash same cause the sign of the cross on the forehead. The action takes place in this temple by the priests. In doing so, are pronounced or evangelical word ' repent and believe in the Gospel ', or the old testament, from the book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible: ' Remember that you are dust and to dust will '. Some churches taken in the temple washed the ashes as a symbol of cleansing from sin, and in others, on the contrary, keep this cross, as though carrying peace sign of his repentance.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In temples on this day the priests wear in purple (Purple is the color of the post) and reads the Gospel of Luke, John the Baptist preaching about repentance. In the middle ages on Ash Wednesday with both temples sounded anathema to address unrepentant sinners. Because of this, according to contemporaries, many people were afraid to approach close to temples, fearing to hear personally anathema. In our tolerant time is hardly possible, although in some cases, perhaps, it would be quite appropriate and even useful.<p><p><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Sunday of the prodigal son returning home</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The first mention of the Church practice of laying the ashes on the head of the penitent relate to III-IV centuries. And in the trebnikah (prayer books) of the Western Churches on Ash Wednesday is already at the time of Pope Gregory the great, Saint obshhehristianskogo, who lived in the 6th century. This practice became widespread in the 10th century, and the canons of the Church firmly entrenched only in the 14th. One of the first references on this day can be found at the Anglo-Saxon Abbot Jelfrika (955-1020): ' we read in books and Old and new testament that people kajavshiesja of their sins, put yourself ash and dressed his body in rags. Let us make this a little at the beginning of this post, sprinkled ashes on our heads in commemoration of the fact that we should bring forth repentance in our sins during Lent '.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>English monk totally rights is itself a sign of ash dropping repentance or sorrow found already on the pages of the most ancient books of the Bible. ' I deny it and repent in dust and ashes ' — says the righteous Job the long-suffering (job 42:6). ' Sit on the ground silently elders o daughters of Sionovoj, put ashes on their heads, prepojasalis vretishhem; lowered his head to the Earth the Virgin of Jerusalem ',-we read in the famous cry of Jeremiah.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Ash, which is sprinkled with the head of believers in this day is special. It appears after the burning of willow branches or Palm trees that were dedicated on Palm (Palm) Sunday.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The ashes, of course, only symbolizes repentance and cannot replace it. Without a living, effective repentance no strewing themselves whatever it is will not have the slightest sense — in this solidarity all Christians, regardless of their practice of rituals. Some Protestants even moved away from custom to sprinkle the head ashes, retaining, nevertheless, less, the very name ' Ash Wednesday '. But their more traditional cousins it is reasonable notice that rituals do not just exist and carry a specific meaning. Man is a creature not only rational, he lives in space characters. Remove or modify the character is in one way or another, affect the content.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Therefore, nowadays, as a thousand years ago, Ash Wednesday the priests and pastors in many countries of the world, sprinkled ashes on the heads of their parishioners. Moscow temples is no exception. Today, Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans and some other Christian community in Moscow will make this beautiful ancient rite, turning thoughts to repent of their sins, and hearts to God.</p><p>Embed <strong>News religion from truth.

Gust was sincere, fervent, found support from leadership Academy and Ivan Kasatkin at their own desired was postrizhen in monks. In inochestve he called name is Nikolay. He was ordained a deacon in on the feast of STS. Peter and Paul (1860-m) and the priest — the next day, a day of commemoration of the Cathedral of the twelve apostles. This was the sign for a young priest, who expected a difficult but truly apostolic works.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Now hieromonk Nicholas stood in the path of the Japanese city of Hakodate. Here not so long ago, in 1858, the year was opened by the Russian consulate. The first consul was appointed Joseph Antonovich Goshkevich, he became warden of the first orthodox temple in Japan-consular resurrection Church. Built and sanctified the temple priest Vasiliy Makhov, but a year later due to illness, he returned to his homeland and appealed to the Synod Goshkevich requesting another priest.

He had a strong foreign accent, but this did not prevent him from being understood by all Japanese from small to great wealth and ease of building a dictionary of phrases gave his speech force, which led to the delight of all Japanese. Phrases were brief, the most unexpected, but extremely vibrant and strong, ""wrote prominent early 20th century Russian Orientalist, d. m. Pozdneev.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Russia-rescuer of persecuted Christians</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>And here at last is the first fruit of the seed fell on good soil, the first spiritual victory. Takuma savabe, he was a respected priest-sintoist, former Samurai, was an excellent swordsman and taught this art son Russian Consul I.a. Goshkevicha. Ieromonah Nikolay, faced the Consul with the Japanese, couldn't help but notice the hatred with which he looks at him. The matter finally came to a direct explanation. Savabe — an ardent Patriot of his country, baldly stated that all foreigners-spies, all of them need to kill. And that Russian priest is the main enemy, because preaching alien faith hurt Japan. On this Holy Nicholas calmly and quite rezano countered: How can you decry someone's teachings, even without being familiar with him? He invited Savabe to listen first, and then judge. Samurai acknowledged the validity of this argument and agreed to hear ieromonaha Nikolay.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>What I heard Japanese, it became for him to utter surprise, a kind of spiritual shock. He even asked his father Nicholas permissions come to him for a new conversation, and on the first lesson brought ink and brush to record the words of the preacher. The story of Christianity, so engrossed in the Savabe that the priest asked father Nicholas Scripture and that no one noticed that he is studying the Gospel, read it in his pagan temple during services, tapping at the same time the ritual drum. ' Nobody thought I read foreign heresy, ""told priest subsequently.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>What the result brought conversations with father Nikolai savabe, wrote in a letter dated 20 April 1865 onwards: ' The priest eagerly waiting on me. He is well educated, intelligent, eloquent and untiringly devoted to Christianity. The sole purpose of his life is now — to serve the fatherland the spread of Christianity, and I have to constantly stop his request out of concern that he has not lost his head, before you have time to do anything for this purpose '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>A year later, Savabe brought to father Nikolai, his friend, doctor Sakai. A year later they were joined by doctor Uranium. Friends began to hold themselves katehizatorskie interviews, and already in the spring of 1868, about two dozen Japanese were ready to be baptized.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Orthodox mom: how we baptized the son</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Not accidentally the first inhabitants of Japan, who in their hearts the orthodox doctrine of Christ, became a Samurai. In the era of the Meiji era ' Enlightened ' board — these people, adherents of the old Japan, experienced the crisis caught superfluous in their country. Possessing a special warehouse thinking, desperately in need of noble ideals, capable of a dedication, they were open to a new elevated and bright ideas. In orthodoxy, they got more than the idea of faith in Jesus Christ and serve him, which includes concrete actions aimed as on self-improvement and change of life around him. Becoming a priest, Takuma (baptized Pavel) Savabe talked about that one must first change yourself in order to change something in their own country. And there is no doubt that Saint Nicholas, knowingly postigavshij the spirit of Japanese people managed to find such words through which the feat of Christ-God who serve people and save them with his godmother death is penetrated to the heart of the Samurai. Because for these people, the word ' service ', ' dedication ', ' sacrifice ' were never empty. As well as unity, common cause is ' Samurai without a clan is not a Samurai in General '. The Orthodox faith has offered exactly that — a spiritual community, a new family, common cause.<p><p>Therefore, in spite of that, the number of the faithful Japanese increased. Father Nicholas had very difficult. In addition to the spiritual difficulties — a different kind of monastic temptations, moral — suspicion and hostility from others, he was experiencing difficulties and material — had to take every penny. Indeed, the situation was very volatile.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The life of St. Nicholas was an important step. The beginning of a radical transformation of Japan has made possible the establishment of the Russian spiritual mission ' to preach among the Gentiles the word of God ' in Japanese. To do this, in the year 1869 father Nicholas is sent to St. Petersburg. After many efforts planned in 1870 and took year students returned to their native country, it has already become the rank of Archimandrite-as the head of the Russian spiritual mission. Had a lot of work.</p><p style='text- style=''></p style='text-> align: justify; ' ><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Holy Nina, which gave Georgia Christ</strong><p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In 1874, were the first priests ordained from the Japanese Mission in Tokyo and Hakodate operated six schools, the first cathedral of the Japanese Orthodox Church, identified the methodology of the sermon at the national level. In 1875 year opened Tokyo seven years of seminary, and from 1877 onwards began to be published the first Japanese Orthodox magazine. Service in communities and teaching was conducted in their native language. Translation into Japanese language prayer books is one of the most important achievements of St. Nicholas. He wrote that in Japan ' when love people to read and in the development of respect for the printed word, faithful and delivered first and foremost you need to give a book written in their native language surely good syllable and thoroughly nice and cheap issued '. Interpreting the writings of St. Nicholas and his Japanese Assistant, Paul played Nakai a huge role in the approval of orthodoxy in Japan, creating a basis for original Japanese Orthodox dictionary.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In the year 1879 St. Vladimir, Nikolay noted: ' typical for Orthodox Japan what Orthodox mission, just 8 years old when two existing during that time existing missionaries, without certain material, the number of Christians has been already twice stronger than the Catholic and Protestant missions all together '. In the year 1880 Archimandrite Nikolai was appointed to the position of Bishop, vicar of the Diocese of Riga with a permanent seat for Japan. His consecration took place in Russia and during his brief stint at home students collected many donations to the Tokyo resurrection Cathedral. Majestic temple at the top of the Hill was built by architect Dai Suruga Joshua Conder, an Englishman known as the Builder of the Imperial Palace. Cathedral of the Resurrection of the Lord was consecrated in 1891 year, immediately becoming one of the the main attractions of the Japanese capital and a symbol of orthodoxy in Japan. He became popularly known as ' Nikolay-up to ' (' the Temple of Nicholas ').<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In the year 1904 Russo-Japanese war began. The Russian Embassy left Japan — remained the only prelate Nikolay. In this one act of his entire depth described the feat, the power of faith and love for Japan, which has become already native and close, love the priest to the flock. Of course, Christianity persecution again, both at the national religion hated the Russians. At the same time in Russia at St. were viewed as obsessed with the strange human delusions, and even — an enemy spy.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Candlemas — meeting of man and God</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>But orthodoxy is more than Russia. Prelate was aware of this — and blessed his flock to pray for the victory of the Japanese weapons. He himself did not participate in these prayers. At the time of his very concerned the fate of Russian prisoners of war, which by the end of the war, there were 70,000 people. Bishop tried to help them as best I could, sent to the POWs of the Japanese Orthodox priests, because he himself was not even allowed into the camps. During the war the Japanese Orthodox proven loyalty to the fatherland and at the same time, taking care of Russian prisoners of war, became an example of the Christian attitude towards the enemy.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>After the war, everything fell into place — a rare tact and wisdom-to-the-Apostles Nikolay were appreciated by Japan society. Decades of selfless work, love for Japan and its inhabitants, the rare scholarship and great personal charm won him recognition not only those who have accepted the Orthodox faith.</p><p>According to the archpriest and. Vostorgova: ' there was no person in Japan, after the Emperor, who was there in the country. In the capital of Japan did not have to ask where the Russian Orthodox mission rather it was to say one word ' Nicholas ', and literally every rickshaw immediately knew where needed to deliver a guest mission. And the Orthodox Church called ' Nicholas ', and also mission ' Nicholas ', even the orthodoxy was called called ' Nicholas '. Traveling around the country in the clothes of a Russian priest, we always and everywhere were greeted by affectionate gaze, and in the words of greeting and conversation about us we caught hearing among obscure words and expressions of an unfamiliar language one familiar and dear: ' Nicholas ' ...

It congratulated the Japanese Emperor and the Governor of Tokyo, Japanese press and foreign missions. ' It seems to me, said Tokyo Governor, is that those merits which provided our State teacher Venerable Nicholas, not limited to the success of a missionary, but also lies in the fact that he contributed to the civilization in our country. '<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The Lord spoke about themselves: ' is there any merit at the plough, which a farmer once field? How can it boast: ' Look-Ka, Orthodox, that I caused! ' ...

He was then 75 years old. For half a century the activities of prelate in Japan appeared 31 984 believers Orthodox churches, 265 41 priest 15 choral conductors, 121 Catechist.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Honoring educator of Japan as a Saint began long before He was glorified by the Russian Orthodox Church (already in our time, April 10, 1970 onwards) as St. Vladimir Nicolaus, Archbishop of Japanese.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The successor of St. Nicholas became Bishop Sergius (Tikhomirov). Is he worthy of Pastoral Ministry, cross bore but further developments unfolding in the history of the world, strongly challenged the Orthodox Church in Japan, after the revolution of 1917, she actually became a self-governing, deprived of financial support. The second world war brought new difficulties for orthodoxy in Japan. As a result, Japanese Church became part of the American Archdiocese of the Russian Orthodox Church abroad, although a minority of Japanese flock continued its existence as a Japanese Diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In 1969, the year in a number of meetings and Cathedrals, it was decided to establish a stand-alone Japanese Church under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. At the moment it comprises three Diocese: Diocese of Western Tokyo, Japan Center in Kyoto and the Diocese of Eastern Japan, with its centre in Sendai.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Although the number of Orthodox in comparison with the beginning of the century, practically has not decreased, now Japanese autonomous Orthodox Church is experiencing considerable difficulties. Traditionally, Japan mnogokonfessionalna, and now, in the modern atheistic era in Ney besides reigns pretty superficial attitude to any religion. Orthodoxy is perceived by the Japanese as a kind of philosophy, exotic doctrine, and no more. Many Japanese, indifferent to the very essence of any religion, and can participate in Shinto and Buddhist rituals, as well as attend Orthodox churches not joining at the same time in the life of the Church.</p><p>There are problems within the Church, the still unresolved many questions — of monastic life, the National School of icon painting and the standard Slav-Japanese dictionary. In addition Patriarchate of Constantinople and a number of local churches still did not recognize Japanese autonomy.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Now the number of Christians of all denominations in Japan does not exceed one percent of the population, most of them Catholics and Protestants. Still, the deal, which gave the whole life of St. Vladimir, Nikolay, not killing — Orthodox Christianity alive in the Japan, and hopefully ever — thanks to the worthy spiritual successors of St. Nicholas from priests and laity — it will shine its rays beautiful country of the rising sun — from the edge and the edge.</p><p>Embed <strong>News religion from truth.

  Great post and Soviet dietetics","
  Great post and Soviet dietetics",great-post-and-soviet-dietetics,https://img.pravda.ru/image/article/3/9/3/400393.jpeg,"<p class='lead'><strong>Came the great post-long six weeks Orthodox Christians have to strictly refrain from eating. Especially strict rules relating to the first week of lent and the last is predpashalnoj passionate. But often Christians hear in your address reproaches from the unbelieving loved ones saying that post is one injury.</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Indeed, the atheistic Soviet times relevant literature was full of terrible data on ' the terrible dangers of posts as an element of religious obscurantism '. The evidence cited, for example, scientific data about that person needs a day about 80 grams of pure protein — otherwise, his body begins to ' Digest ' the tissue of the organism. Approximately the same thing mentioned and on the total caloric intake.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>But when the average citizen of the USSR otvrashhal look from leaflets of zaideologizirovannyh ' knowledge society ', he discovered a curious things. Anywhere in the then ' food service ' by order ' at the top ' there were so-called ' fish days ', in which only prepared fish dishes. As a rule, these were Tuesday and Thursday — apparently, in spite of the Church with its fast Wednesday and Friday. Although Soviet-atheist still, perhaps without knowing it, simultaneously poured water on the mill another religion is Judaism. In Orthodox currents which made fast just in Tuesday and Thursday.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>In addition, despite the fact that the term ' post ' wore a clearly negative connotations — the Union very well developed branch of medicine called ' diet '. But any diet is based primarily on abstinence. Whether from a certain type of product, whether from excessive caloric content. Existed and frankly ' meatless ' options, which give the ' odds ' many statutory requirements the most strict of the Holy fathers-hermits. Like the so-called ' discharge ' days — in which were instructed to eat only apples, cucumbers, watermelons etc. Note that in those days, the purpose of such diets was not adhering to standards of beauty from Hollywood ' stars ' and Super models that could bring to a starvation of practicing their durochek accident — but it is a real benefit to the health of the average citizens.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Eve of Lent: repentance without intermediaries</strong></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Why people should not eat, ' as the body requires '? The meaning is: wanted tasty — to eat it until full satiety, and so every day. The answer to this can be found in evolutionary biology of mankind. Take, for example, the primitive society, representing a community of hunters. Good extraction does not come across every day, Hunt accounted for sometimes a few transitions from day camps. Naturally, at this time and hunters and their families starving, elementary only mildly relieving appetite gathered berries-roots.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>But here's the fortunate kromanoncam encountered any mammoth. Move it to the whole when the carcass was physically impossible — to leave a significant part valuable meat simply pathetic. Begin the feast — without departing from the place of good hunting. Moreover, people knew at the subconscious level — next luck maybe Oh how soon. Why ' otedalis from the belly ', accumulating excess calories in fat body reserves. To use them during fodder.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Similar food stereotype existed practically till our days, except that one is for representatives of the richest classes. And then, the relatively-during wars, blockades, mass disasters suffered by all. And, other things being equal, those who had survived the ' social ' accumulation is more serious. No wonder the ideal of feminine beauty in the 17th century were ' rubensovskie ladies ' is a pyshnotelye, as opposed to the current hudjushhim ' modelkam '.<p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Now practically the mechanism does not work. The inhabitants of modern cities and even villages are no longer need to hunt mammoths — just go to the nearest grocery store. Where even the poorest can provide daily calories at least bread and pasta. Even and especially worry about droughts or floods, threaten to ruin the crops in the fields also is missing products can be purchased on the importing.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>But stuffy at the genetic level nutrition stereotype still continues: ' maybe tomorrow hunger? Better eat Pro stock '. And naedaemsja is most delicious when possible. Which, again according to the stereotype, usually the most caloric — fatty, sweet and so on. Only appetite we have quite the level of ancient hunters, and work as the average representative office ' plankton '.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Read also:</strong> <strong>Eve of Lent: the last judgment-Court grace?</strong><p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Accordingly, all eaten Pro stock goes into ' those extra pounds '. Unfortunately, very few are trying to expel them additional physical activity, fitness, or even walks in the fresh air. The rest are more or less pronounced the overweight and the obese and frank. Payback for that sooner or later become hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis (when vessels become clogged with fatty plaques), heart attacks, strokes.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>So in a purely medical sense Orthodox practice meatless days (which, given all the great posts and Wednesday-Friday took sometimes more six months) is not just tolerable, but desirable. The main thing is not to forget that the post is not just ' diet for health ', and an important element in spiritual growth.

Care of Donald Trump will not improve relations between the United States and Europe, believes the program director of the Russian Council on Foreign Affairs Ivan Timofeyev. His views he expressed in an interview with ' the truth. Roux '.</p><p>Although relations Euro-Atlantic allies not completely stalled, Europe is not tumbles into the arms of Russia and will not participate in the Eurasian integration projects. Europe is afraid of Russian expansion, therefore, will continue to bet on an alliance with the United States, which ensures security, said in an interview with ' the truth. Roux ' Ivan Timofeyev.</p><p>And the fact that Russia is beneficial to the ' strong Europe ', as the Conference said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, does not mean that Moscow will not develop bilateral relations with European countries, but open to bet on the collapse of the EU is not in line with Moscow's diplomacy political scientist noted for ' truth. ' Roux. Merkel still long will define policy in Europe, even after his departure from the post of Chancellor, therefore her opinion should be heeded.<p><p>The European Union would not support the United States in their policy of confrontation with Russia, would continue to cooperate with Russia, and if they would ' punish ' Moscow sanctions only for something that feels dangerous, for example, for the ' behavior ' in Ukraine. Europe would not support the United States in their position to withdraw from the Treaty on intermediate and short-range missiles (DRSMD) and obstructing the construction of the gas pipeline Nord Stream '-2 ', said in an interview with ' the truth. Roux ' Ivan Timofeyev. Rusofoby such a position, Merkel did not, but they will have to accept, as this objective processes.</p><p><strong>—</strong> <strong>The annual Munich Security Conference remembered that it is the year 2007, President Vladimir Putin issued a sharp criticism of the West and said that Russia will go its own way. this year, Vladimir</strong> Vladimirovich came to the Conference, as well as Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. Americans still sent a large delegation led by Vice President Michael Pensom and a group of senators.<p><p><strong>Ivan Nikolaevich, former President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who is famous for its Russophobia, said that ' since the last Conference, I was depressed, but after the present realized that then it was optimism '. In your opinion, what is he so unhappy?</strong></p><p>He is one of the Veterans of this Conference, participated in a large number of meetings year after year, so he has something and something to compare. In this case, rather, on the overall assessment of the Conference. Well, naturally, there is growing concern at the uncertainty. This is well illustrated in the report of the Conference, which appeared the day before.</p><p>There stated that the inability of international relations is growing. On the one hand, there is concern about a number of already famous calls: conflict with Russia, all sorts of conflicts, unstable Middle East, cybersecurity, etc. And, of course, concerned that the United States policy uncertainty grows.<p><p>And this is totally unacceptable to the European Union. Although this concern was last Munich Conference, and on the week. But just then there was a sense of hope that this will resolve and not rassosalos. And it is not clear what to do with this, as many think, the eccentric President of Trump.</p><p>He just prodavlivaet its course. And, of course, Europe worries regarding security and transatlantic relations. Although, on the other hand, this concern to some extent, contrived and overdone. Well, Yes, worried, but institutions are constantly changing. And neither for them nor for us so far, no major changes.</p><p><strong>— Sergey Lavrov spoke very quietly, urged Europe to free itself from the influence of the United States</strong> and together with Russia to build a Eurasian home. Good suggestion ... But whether this Europe?<p><p>Of course, no. And for many reasons. First, the United States is a key guarantor of European security. United States, in effect, assumed the burden of its security. Due to this, the EU States have relatively low military spending, and they may feel comfortable enough and protected under the American umbrella.</p><p>And secondly, it is a very powerful economic alliance with the United States. Still, the United States is one of the key trade partners despite the fact that the EU have a disagreement on a number of issues, there are signs of a trade war between the EU and the United States. But quite often occurs between partners, so it is rather normal.</p><p>And the sheer volume of the trades of the EU and the United States fatalen. Of course, the EU does not exchange it for any ghostly relationship with Russia. It is not comparable. And therefore in Europe in response to our proposal saying: ' Yes, we can probably build a more stable system to Vladivostok, But first you do those things and those conditions, accept our conditions of Ukraine. ' Well, and the next begins.<p><p>It is clear that EU cooperation with us does not cease, but also strongly develop will not be a single step in our side will not make. But the fact that the EU is education, which would for many years. Therefore, we will need to build relations and with private capitals, and with the European Union.

Just two months ago the Prime Minister Medvedev stated that ' we change trend on falling incomes ' and suddenly grows concerned with reality.</strong></p><p>The Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev has instructed heads of regions to analyse the structure of incomes of Russians and to propose measures for their increase. The head of the Cabinet asked to perform a task until May 1 of this year and provide the results of the analysis of labor and trade of the Russian Federation.</p><p>Order kontrastituet with bravurnymi statements beginning December last year that the population's real incomes in Russia ' grow faster than other countries ' and ' in the year 2018 will increase by 1.6%, with an increase in real wages at the level of 7.6%.</p><p>' This means that we change trend on the fall in income. It was the most terrible, the most dangerous thing for the country, the most socially-rocking fact most precarious circumstance, ""the Prime Minister said. Note that an even more optimistic forecast issued The Ministry of economic development, according to his data, real incomes in the year 2018 had to grow by 3.4%.<p><p>Such a mood of URA-Government managed to hold out until the beginning of January 2019 year after Rosstat reported that Russians ' real income (Rosstat corrects them on inflation and mandatory payments) following the 2018 year decreased by 0.2%. Rehabilitation Rosstatu, already in the second half they went negative, so what Medvedev and Minjekonomrazvitjai did in December concluded that they will plus is not clear.</p><p>Thus, the year 2018 was the fifth year of continuous decline in real incomes of the population. In the year 2017 the reduction amounted to 1.2% in 2016-5.8%, 2015-3.2%, 2014-0.7%.</p><p>And here it should be noted that real income is not only income, adjusted for inflation and mandatory payments. There are also optional for Rosstat, but required the population payments is interest on loans, mortgages, for treatments and cures. You and me also know, Rosstat does not supervise the shadow sector of economy, which covers 28 of 72 million employed citizens. This is the most poorly paid part of the Russian labour market, citizens here are paid on a grey, or black, and have them all worse.<p><p>As found in the survey of Russian experts, 22 per cent of the population live in poverty and can afford only a minimal set of very simple ingredients. In the area of consumer risk are still 35.6 per cent of the respondents, i.e. they have a normal diet and buy casual wear, but the acquisition of non-expendable equipment (furniture, computer, refrigerator, smartphone) causes great difficulty, and prospects improve material status no.</p><p>It is clear why income which had retired, so you need this part of the population. And why pension reform so dropped the credibility of Medvedev and his Government, as well as to the President.</p><p>It is also understandable that after Vladimir Putin, the appeals Learn, and how there actually in regions with incomes, Medvedev had to do something. But will use the study ordered by him/her? After all, it will be a kind of referendum on a vote of confidence in the Cabinet. Whether governors are honest, because almost all of them from the United Russia party ', as Medvedev? Therefore, we are talking about honor its Mundhir and the results of the next election.<p><p>As the saying ' the truth. Roux ' <strong>head of Macroeconomics of the Centre for macroeconomic analysis and short-term forecasting (SAYS) Dmitry Belousov</strong>, the revenues we have considered very bad as expenses, while the accumulated errors in calculations. According to the expert, judge real incomes should be on how the population evaluates its material situation. It seems, according to the polls, that ' something must be done ', said Dmitry Belousov. But leverage the Government not very many, and the ones that have already tapped is the allowances, pensions and so forth, continued it.<p><p>' With the pension reform we of recipients of income excluded every year will exclude further categories of citizens. In a situation where revenues dropped greatly, we suddenly have this reform. Plus these citizens approaching retirement age, which we obliged to labour activity, will put pressure on the labour market, competing indirectly and deterring the growth of wages, ""the expert said.</p><p>According to Dmitry Belousov, the Government controls three kinds of income. This salary in the budgetary sector — through the minimum wage as well as pensions and allowances. But Medvedev, apparently, is not about this, on incentives and raise wages in the private sector, the expert said. The situation there is determined by salary in budgetary sector, general market conditions, the availability of income, and ' here is a little leverage, it is necessary to increase productive jobs on a different fret '.</p><p>' Maybe start with the support of small business, something else you can pull through structural policies and dialogue with the regions.

Typically, this problem with many unknowns, which becomes the destiny of the individual. And it's no longer dry arithmetic is the life and death of each one of us.</strong></p><p>Who and when thought why in Japan developed Robotics? The responses on these islands have gathered scientific geniuses or there the highest salary, initially wrong. Among the most economically developed countries, Japan has the lowest birth rate, the population is aging rapidly and the flow of migrants is not and is not expected in the near future.</p><p>Recently, in the land of the rising sun, the emphasis is on artificial intelligence. If the old Japanese still served a glass of water, living people, his widow othlebnet water from hands of idols. Joking aside: technical progress and automation is more developed in those countries where are faced with a demographic problem.<p><p>In a developed Germany (unlike Switzerland) where the run ready for reproduction of migrants, but with very low educational qualifications, the geniuses in science may be the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of contemporaries, but has no direct siblings. However, the Swiss will face insurmountable difficulties.</p><p>The retirement age is now entering the largest post-war generation. This is a consequence of the so-called baby boomers, when in the majority of European countries, including the SOVIET UNION, suffered unprecedented population increase. Alas, the outgoing generation itself could not provide continuity probably more anxious purely materialistic things or worthless material problems. Because their ancestors braved the bloody war and revolution continued to be fruitful and multiply.</p><p>Now, in view of the demographic development, Governments have to make allowances by several factors. Firstly, inflows dropped significantly in many respects, qualified specialists from the former socialist countries and the Soviet Union. Secondly, what age should count out retirement savings?<p><p>On the one hand, the World Health Organization (who) surely increases the age of old age, and, on the other hand, we increasingly notice that young people growing up much later. A clear example: the future emperor Napoleon became Brigadier General in 24 years. A more recent example: the future writer Arkady Gaidar was appointed commander of the Regiment, when he had not yet reached the age of 18 years.</p><p>And it's not in the military! Not everyone becomes an outstanding Commander in young years as Alexander the great, who became a great before 33 years. Modern youth matures later. According to statistics, the average age of the founders of startups now reaches 45 years. But more recently talked about the so-called ' crisis four decades of age '.

Yes and not only poets?<p><p>Of course, for a long time worked in the same company have a certain advantage — demand this company skills, knowledge and experience. On the other hand, the excessive specialization carries the risk, when this specific experience are no longer in demand on the market.

The last reason arises from the insufficient number of days for recovery or too heavy exertion during exercise. Know and be able to stay at the right moment is a nice plus for an athlete, but ignorance of own forces and their inability to calculate is a big minus. The most frequently suffer newcomers zealously rushing into battle and wishing for an week reach heavenly heights. Everything comes gradually, and normal physical form is no exception. If the horizon arises one of the symptoms described below, you must reduce the load and try to feel the body.</p><p>When light podragivanijah don't worry — this is a normal process, pointing to muscle fatigue. It helps develop muscle tissue and make it stronger. But when the occurrence of frequent cuts, disturbing and uncomfortable, it is worth considering to reduce load. The prolonged shivering can harm the joints and ligaments, you must reset the speed or weight with rods, or just relax a bit. Training should continue when the jerking stops. And if the coach said about the normality of this process, you do not need to listen to his words. Better to preserve health and listen to your own body.<p><p>Frequent respiration is not always a big reason to stop and rest. But in the case when the air literally can't breathe, begins to emerge feeling that can suffocate, immediately to stop the exercises. Restore breathing help, deep breaths and sighs, they need to focus and try not to worry.</p><p>High pulse rate during a long cross said about the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. But track pulsovye zone still need. To do this, the person will need a heart rate monitor that attaches to the hand or attached to a belt. When controlling the pulse will be able to keep track of what moments lesson becomes dangerous for the heart. If the heart rate monitor stayed home, you will need to follow the body alone. Just stop for a few minutes and try to say the usual sentence. If words cannot articulate and present pulsirovanie in temples, exercise at the time to stop. If you continue with the lesson, there may be the risk of dizziness and headaches accompanied by nausea.<p><p>Mistakes committed by two options: people have not yet understood the correct technique execution or not enough forces to do exercise. Coach always said that an athlete or not specifically wants to work actively, or really tired. Easy breather can't hurt and will only get better. With renewed vigour and a good mood you can continue with the lesson or go home, and the next day to perform all exercises correctly.<p><p>Photo: 6pack. ru</p><p><strong>More on this topic:</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Overtraining</strong> is the problem of persistent</strong></p><p><strong>Principles for a safe workout</strong></p><p><strong>Fitness addiction</strong></p><p>Embed a <strong>Sport from the truth.

' Roux Inna Novikova</strong> told <strong>the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Fund for the development of the digital economy Herman Klimenko.</strong></p><p><strong>-Herman s., recently actively promoted modern technologies in medicine, particularly telemedicine. You are a proud supporter and has already done much to implement the project in remote areas of the North. However, there is such a medical philosophy and important postulate that it is necessary to treat the disease and not the patient. If there are concerns that modern technology greatly set back</strong> a doctor from the patient? Maybe your doctor to see a patient in the eye, because everyone has their own approach to illness and treatment, so often it is necessary to motivate human healing. Or really need to treat strictly according to the protocols, die-all one way and strive to make the robots did the surgery?<p><p>— Let us remember Anton Pavlovich Chekhov. He was he was a doctor, but it was an infinite number of years ago. At the time resorted to him fellow and said, ' doctor, doctor, Aglafi have a pimple on the ass. What should I do? ' to which he quite rightly said: ' Drag ' Aglafju here! Because some pimple he did not know whether any little.</p><p>And it is understandable that people and society have formed some connectome (the complete description of the structure of relationships in the nervous system of the body. — <strong>ed.</strong>). This is such a term psychologists and psychotherapists have meaning in my head played strong track, which is strictly followed. Because doctors were really gods, because they saved lives. Then and zalozhilas basis of these white towers, clean raincoats and Holiness primary reception.<p><p>But then there were no smartphones, blood tests, and MRI ECT, then there was nothing at all. And if x-rays, blood tests and, if necessary, else why doctor patient? What do you want from him in the eyes to see?</p><p>Just now the most important thing is to add a second part to this story is the relationship, and that is all. How many of us from the settlements? 88 thousand. Let's remove 68 thousand very small, forget about them. How many of us, such as endocrinologists or urologists, Gynecologists? Roughly the same — seven thousand. It turns out the 20 thousand large and more or less secondary settlements — on 7000 gynaecologists, endocrinologists and urologists. And how many of them live in Moscow? Almost half. And yet nearly half where he lives? In Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk and several other major cities. In the end, really qualified medical assistance most unavailable in General.<p><p>Why oncologist for histology patient? Yes he did not need it. The pathologist generally did not see the patient. Why would they need an oncologist? There is no reason, in addition to the stereotype, in addition to the desire to control the patient. Doctors have their own challenges. They really aren't very fond of taking foreign patients because it is unclear what happened to them before.</p><p>Three-four years ago, I ran for all doctors and said: ' colleagues, I looked, we can teach this iron not only beat Kasparov, but also identify diabetic retinopathy. We do not need to be for that ophthalmologists '. They said: ' Herman, it's heresy '. And we three years with this theme were running, while American FD is not said: ' we will license the algorithm '. And most importantly, they said: ' Without a doctor '. Do not need a doctor anymore. Legalized in America history, when artificial intelligence serves as cm. Centimeter never cross, right? And now it turns out that with me now talk: ' Herman, and come back to this topic '. I say: ' too late '. Already have a licensing of artificial intelligence. Without a doctor.<p><p>This is the answer to the question of whether the primary reception. Probably yes, if necessary. Why not.

That is why the dog, unlike cats, does not like to be one. It is so very uncomfortable. Accordingly, the closer the dog sleeps to the owner, so for her quieter. And it is precisely this factor can solve a lot of dog psychological problems: insecurity, excessive nervousness dogs trust ...</p><p>After all, sleeping in the Holy of Holies, in bed (den) host, incredibly nice for a pet. But often your puppy determine the place far from the hosts. He whines and cannot get used to this. This is a wrong upbringing. The closer the dog is a person, so it will be calmer and more confident.<p><p><strong>-Dogs love by hook or by crook to climb through in master bed. Of course, you can understand them — there is warm and cozy, the next favourite people. But is it possible to allow the dogs to sleep</strong> <strong>in the master bed, or do need to aggressively combat these actions?</strong></p><p>I always tell everyone that this even needs to be done. Because the dog is a social creature. And if you look at the Pack of stray dogs, then how would they ever get together, especially when they sleep. Firstly, it is safe. And it is warm. Such unity as a social individual dog is very necessary.</p><p>Because of weak dogs who are sick or cannot perform any function in a flock in the wild banished from the Pack. And these dogs then raises many problems. Because unlike cats dog always uncomfortable to be one.

Because, of course, sleep in the Sanctum sanctorum in the Lair of the owner, is super as pleasantly and as well. But it often happens that when having a puppy he define a place far away from the host.</p><p>Then he howls, Whines, may not get used. But as soon as the hosts move its litter (even if not on the bed, but at least in my bedroom), then he calms down, because it is already in flight.</p><p>I understand that there are very large dogs that won't fit in the bed, people can be allergic to dogs and not everyone is willing to sleep with the shaggy beasts. But the closer the dog is a person, so it will be quieter, the more confident it will be, the stronger will be its sleep, it will not start up at night and do something about it. That is, the unity of the dog with the man, including through joint dreams in one single space.</p><p><strong>— How to correctly</strong> to build a dialogue of man and dog? And whether this dialogue?<p><p>In fact, the dialogue is always needed, because it is in the dialogue, you can resolve any questions that bother the owner and the dog. Dog speak poses her body. And if you know them well, you can understand what she feels.</p><p>On the Internet there are so many videos on which the dog pressed ears, looking at the owner very unhappy gaze, ponytail, preloaded it needle is licked. The host can scold in the background and waving the reality for pogryzennym. Some of this video seems very touching, that's what a nice crumb, people laugh.</p><p>But in fact, this dog is in a very big stress. Because she perceives as master cursing aggression on the part of the person. And she doesn't understand why her punished. Dogs live in the here and now. What they did an hour ago, they can already do not remember. Many say they know exactly when the dog who foozled.</p><p>So I went in the morning — it at once wrote, I come in the evening — the dog hides. Yes, it will hide, but not because she already wrote, but because she's already afraid that man comes home, and his dog was waiting for all day. But a puddle dog already forgot completely.<p><p>She then bark furiously from a rescue real bird outside the window, potrepala cat, pospala, ate, popila vodichku, did pretty much everything, poslonjalas apartment, pogryzla sneakers. And the boss comes in and starts her scold. For the dog that means unjustified aggression, which she could not understand.</p><p>If you punish the dog then immediately at the time of making the dog a bad action. Everything! Neither before nor after. If you missed this moment means ignore the action itself. Simply remove the puddle up off the floor and forget. Did it pay no attention, not attract attention to dogs. Go further.</p><p>Dog body language often shows the owner: I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm not sure or want to play. That is, she has a lot of gestures to convey to master your desires. When a person knows, understands that wants a dog that is dialogue.<p><p>And dogs are changing: become bolder, more confident in yourself. And people change themselves: from the theory of domination they already go to the theory that the dog is an individual, she has her own opinion.
