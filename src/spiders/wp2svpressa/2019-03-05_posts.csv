Economy,The new increase in the retirement age Russia awaits through 5 years,the-new-increase-in-the-retirement-age-russia-awaits-through-5-years,/p/22/226/226439/l-226439.jpg?v=1551762188,"<p>After all the turbulence, which committed the State over the past few years in pension reform, perhaps the only hope the Russians to remain dignified non-governmental pension funds (NPF). Those who managed to transfer their savings part of pensions before the beginning of endless epics with their ""freezing"" (a moratorium on these contributions, extended now to 2021), sincerely believe in obtaining allowances to enable them to somehow make ends to make ends meet.</p><p>However, the harsh economic reality imposes these iridescent plans its neveseluju resolution.</p><p>So, study Association of NPF and the Research Institute of Finance (FINANCIAL) presents: according to the results of the 4th quarter year 2018 profit from future pensioners may suffer up to 5.22 percent, and in the long term for the first quarter of the year 2019 rate risks to fall even lower, to 5.12 percent. It's even worse than the State management company Vneshjekonmbanka (which appears to According to the results of year 2018 on the expanded portfolio of savings, increased money for the future pensioners 6.07%).<p><p>At the same time, <strong>the President of the Central Bank of Elvira Nabiullina</strong> suggested that at the end of March prices growth in annualized reaches in 5.5 − 6%. In other words, we are talking about that all future pension Russians simply ""eaten by inflation."" These results, the authors believe, will become a serious obstacle to attracting private funds in new customers.</p><p>The main reason for this development, experts say, is that the yield of the stock market falls in principle.</p><p>-Negligible rates increase is observed only the last six months, ""says"" JV "" <strong>Deputy General Director of the private pension fund «Open» Denis Rudomanenko</strong>. but until then, they have been declining almost continuously since the beginning of the year 2015. The key rate has decreased from 17% to 7.25%, respectively on the market This time continued a general trend of decreasing profitability. In addition, of course, ambient background, first and foremost, sanctions, provoke serious market volatility, including debt market. The index for the year 2018 Mosbirzhi OFZ showed growth of just 2 percent, and with little in the September drawdown OFZ market reached 3%. So the whole picture is quite logical.<p><p><strong>JV: — what you need to do to increased yield of APF? And that, accordingly, can prevent this?</strong></p><p>-Firstly, you need to still earned a new mechanism of individual pension capital (IPK). Because now the problem of the efficiency of the storage system is not that funds earn little, and that citizens today have virtually no public tools for refilling. If the system was the money that was paid in the form of premiums paid by the employer, now it is possible to play only in the context of private and corporate voluntary programmes, i.e. outside of the storage system.<p><p>Actually, the reform of the IPK is just intended to give access to this tool for all citizens and to make it as easy as possible with the operating point of view. Another component of the reform should be transparency and sustainability of the system. Sustainability, including in law, because the PKI will belong to the State, and not themselves participants in the system, they cannot be, for example, freeze. And the credibility of the system to open opportunities for long-term planning, which, of course, significantly enhance the effectiveness of investments.</p><p><strong>JV: and what about the ratio is still far from impressive inflation ratios and profitability of NPF on the market? Here's what you can fix?</strong></p><p>-For a long time there was a proposal to expand investment Declaration by NPF, enabling them due to competent somewhere diversifying risks getting slightly more than, for example, simply rate on deposit. All of this rests on the new guidelines for monitoring the activities of NPF by the Central Bank. In particular, the mechanism of stress-testing, has earned 2 years ago, which aims to gradually replace the deprecated rules listing what you, the risk-oriented approach, when restrictions on portfolio determined by structure NPF obligations rather than a standard set of rules, one size fits all. And thus, in effect, give more opportunities to earn SPF for its clients, not taking unnecessarily high risks.<p><p><strong>""SP"":-and now we have what?</strong></p><p>-Now some intermediate state when we have running and stress-testing, and formal constraints on the types of attachments to the structure of assets. The Bank of Russia has already repeatedly said: as soon as the risk-oriented approach will be fully deployed, these limitations will begin to quietly withdraw. I think this will be the moment when the funds can feel more comfortable in their aspirations to outrun inflation. In my estimation, this happens in parallel with the reform of the IEC during the next year and a half to two years.<p><p>As we have informed, the concept of PKI is now actively develops the Finance Ministry jointly with the Central Bank. As said <strong>Elvira Nabiullina</strong>, its implementation as soon as possible is a priority, because it is an individual pension capital, she said, ""should breathe new life into the system of retirement savings. First Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister<strong>Anton Siluanov</strong> said earlier that he expected the IEC mechanism starting already from 2020 onwards.</p><p>However, taken by the State in matters of pension system course, believes a number of experts, not radically faithful and any good will not.</p><p>When we talk about reform, ""said SP <strong>pro-Rector Academy of labour and social relations of Alexander Safonov</strong>, — it means that we radically change the whole essence of the system. But instead, was selected best option which, figuratively speaking, ""podmorozil"" the whole system instead of effective problem-solving. Of course, you can try to change fast fast consumable commitments Russia's pension fund, which was done with raising the retirement age. But this is nothing more than a temporary respite. And after 5 years − 4 all the problems which, in fact, have demanded such a quick response, again stand at full height. This is not a pension reform as such, but merely changing a single parameter. So willy-nilly will still have to go back to talking about why the system is still inefficient.<p><p>To overcome the crisis of the Russian expert pension system, it is necessary to abandon the scoring formulas for calculating pensions, significantly raise the SMIC and change the system of premiums. This idea, by the way, Alexander Safonov, together with the <strong>Financial Ombudsman Yuri Voronin</strong> and <strong>Professor</strong> HSE Yevgeny Gontmakher already voiced during the scientific workshop ""policy of active longevity and retirement reform"", Institute of social policy, HSE 28 February.<p><p>Briefly the essence of change is as follows. To begin to combine all three extrabudgetary fund for social insurance (FCMI RPF and FSS) into a single social security fund. With this control over the means of the Organization should not be exercised by the State alone. The right to vote should get the unions and enterprises, and the Government will be the only one of the participants in the General discussion.</p><p>As a result, each inhabitant of the country appears a single insurance policy with a minimum programme for each type of insurance, which must not be abandoned, because people should not be left without any kind of social protection. However, any type of insurance you will ""reinforce"" depending on the desires and needs of each citizen.</p><p>Instead of a points system for calculating pensions It is proposed to introduce payments with each employee salaries in selected his own range (ranging from 11% to 25%). Accrued over decades thus money and return then to citizens in the form of pensions.<p><p>At the same time, the Russians will have the right to go into early retirement, as it is already happening in some European countries. Minimum work experience, taking into account foreign experience will be set at 20 − 25 years to optionally citizen could retire already in 47 years. If this formal experience not to be missed, it can be purchased for a fee.</p><p>is all of this, ""said Alexander Safonov, — will increase the efficiency of the entire system of social insurance in Russia and stop cross-financing system. Because such a unique situation where different categories of payers pay different amounts of insurance funds, while pretending to receive the same pensions, there is no country in the world.</p><p><strong>""SP"" — what it is</strong> Not good?<p><p>— Imagine a situation when the Government says — regardless of how much you put in the Bank, 200 rubles, 400 rubles or more, you get all the same then. What kind of economy we can talk? Nevertheless, we have formed this practice. But pension funds and social security is not the tools for combating poverty. They are created merely to pay a certain amount of social compensation because of events. So much so that situations all differ. Someone, for example, works as a self-employed person, and does not have today no way to pay these contributions. And Yes, people work differently. Someone earned a lot today, and tomorrow a little. But for the Pension Fund is all irrelevant now.</p><p><strong>JV: — indeed, situations differ. For example, in Russia there is an awesome category of people, forced, due to various circumstances, right from school to go to work, and</strong> in low-paying jobs. For these people the proposed changes provided any guarantees?<p><p>-to begin with, and now it is the number one problem. We talked about the fact that one of the problems sushhestvennejshih to balance the pension system so as I would like, is that a certain number of people do not have enough seniority because their labour relations are not processed. And not because people were self-employed, but because that's just the relationship not eligible because the shadow economy. And as a result a person works-works, and then, if you live, gets the minimum social pension.</p><p><strong>JV: — How the problem offer addressed?</strong></p><p>-the only way is the State must offer two options. The first is to modify the terms and conditions under which a person, getting in such conditions, could pay for itself. That is the same redemption that we experience and offered. At the same time, we must assume that the minimum pension shall not be less than the minimum wage. That's out of this and have to count. The second way — the State must change economic conditions that lead to such shady situations. If the State pays low wages to employees, then it is necessary to change the principle of pension schemes. It should not be insured, because when such earnings cumulative system is impossible. 3 years ago, we have calculated that the person receiving the wages at the level of MROTa must have 128 years to accumulate retirement in the amount of the subsistence level.<p><p><strong>JV: So, here's how to be?</strong></p><p>-from our point of view, the State should divide people on a particular principle. For example, a worker in a normal insurance system when the employee pays the employer as it is now. And the second part is the obligation of the State, when the pension becomes a component of the social package, regardless of the size of the paycheck (which by law may not be lower than MROTa). But then the pension should be as in the USSR — distribution, depending on, for example, a post held by in the last 10 years of seniority.<p><p><strong>JV: how likely is it that the Treasury or Labor will implement these ideas?</strong></p><p>-Ministry of finance, most likely, any implementer will not become. His task is different. It solves the situation with a balance of revenues and expenditures of the federal budget. And now, as it seems, he has made the Ministry of finance. Ministry of finance-accountant. Is the money I pay no money — good bye. This functionality just Labor. He must act here. But it's hard to say how much they are willing to, because the famous law official says: do not seek his own orders. In other words, there are order-officials act. No orders — they do nothing. So initiatives from them should not wait.</p><p>But remember, last year <strong>, Mikhail Shmakov</strong> (President of the Federation of independent trade unions of Russia-ed.) went to the President with the proposal to establish a Council on pension reform. Because according to unions and employers to the pension issue is not yet resolved. They have to deal with and not discounted at least two actors ""adjustments"" of the pension system.<p><p>We, as the experts have identified what needs to be done. And then — is the question of negotiations. A matter of time, of course, is worth it. But I wish it was done consistently and with logic. Because by itself, for example, the Union of social funds to the old platform will do nothing. There cannot be, as they say, no words from the song throw away. But again, there are simply no alternatives. For one simple reason — all other alternatives have already tried, it fails.</p><p><strong>Economy News:</strong> West turned Russia into a financial colony with a weak ruble</p>"
