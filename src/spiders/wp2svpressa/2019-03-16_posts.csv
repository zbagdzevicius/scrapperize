The army and the war,"United States and Britain: UN should prevent ""Zircon"", ""Daggers"" and ""Avant-gardes""",united-states-and-britain-un-should-prevent-zircon-daggers-and-avant-gardes,/p/22/227/227539/l-227539.jpg?v=1552741961,"<p>Military expert <strong>Alex Leonkov</strong>, speaking on tv ""Star"", stated that the United States will take all measures to ensure that the world was forbidden to giperzvukovoe weapons. This is due to the fact that Russia and China have committed huge leap in Hypersonic technologies. There are already and the practical results. But American developments in this area of military equipment are, you might say, is in its infancy.</p><p>Russia has already delivered on armament manevrirujushhij Hypersonic block Avangard and airborne missiles ""Dagger"" and x-32. On the approach of anti-ship missile ""Zircon"". China has also established a workable Hypersonic DF unit-ZF, which are equipped with ballistic missiles. In the United States work are at the stage of research.</p><p>Leonkov, a word which leads Portal Avia.pro, said in the broadcast tv programs: ""Americans for a long time talked about the fact that they have a giperzvukovoe weapon. They conducted experiments. But it seems to me that those experiments were made with a specific intent. They were, firstly, spent a lot of money. They all ended one or two launches.<p><p>They now hold a competition to find a developer who will make the front edge of the wing for Hypersonic Flight that it will withstand high temperature and high load. They are only now do it, and we have passed this stage already 30 years ago. We came to the actual technology managed giperzvuka. We came, the Chinese came, but they did not wrong '.</p><p>While the Pentagon understands that American armed forces have no way to protect against Russian Hypersonic missiles. And not only understand, but admit it. Speaking in the Senate a year ago SUN United States strategic command general <strong>John Hajten</strong> said: ""we do not have any protection, which would be able to resist this kind of weapons against the United States. Let me remind you that Russia and China have continued their research in the field of hypersonic opportunities. "" And further made absolutely horrible statement: ""we can only inflict a nuclear strike in response.<p><p>So the United States will seek by hook or by crook to seek legislative prohibition of hypersonic weapons. Well, when it appears from the Pentagon, Americans themselves estimated that this could happen in 30 years, United States ""immediately allow"". This strategy, based on hegemonic ambitions, suggests the gap any contracts and agreements, which have ceased to be profitable. Such is the history and the ABM Treaty, and the Treaty of the INF Treaty.</p><p>The first psychological attack on giperzvukovoe weapons have been taken in the summer of last year. Immediately after a successful test ""Zircon"" initiative ""from below"" was expressed, that is, from the United States satellites.</p><p>At the Symposium, the armed forces of United States strategic command in Nebraska, the representative of the United Kingdom <strong>Paul Berkane</strong> said that British military are watching carefully what progress achieved Russia in the field of hypersonic weapons. And scientists, and designers of foggy Albion are not able to even come close to the achievements of their Russian colleagues. And so, said Berkane, any Hypersonic weapons must be governed by international rules and regulations. That is, because we cannot do it, then you need to associate Russia in the hands and feet.<p><p>In the autumn of the same year to mental attack connected American analysts of the American Research Center of the RAND (Research and Development — ""research and development""). The organization is extremely serious, conducting research for the benefit of the United States Government on security issues on military-technical and strategic aspects. And quite successful financially, receiving annually from the Government of a quarter of a billion dollars.</p><p>The logic of the report ""an obstacle to the dissemination of hypersonic missiles"" is. Someone owners Hypersonic weapons (it is clear whom) want to spread it in third world countries. And zapoluchivshih Hypersonic missiles that it is impossible to intercept, generates the illusion to apply them with impunity. But, of course, the answer was devastating. And start World War III.<p><p>Therefore, China, Russia and the United States should abandon the proliferation not only of ready-made Hypersonic missiles, but also technologies and components, including engines, sensors, navigation systems, telecommunications, fuel. You cannot pass both gratis and for money even design tools and modeling of hypersonic weapons.</p><p>These three States should sit at the negotiation table and sign a document that prevents ""the beginning of a third world war.</p><p>Of course, should develop mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the agreement. And even proposed to elect as supreme arbiter of France. France must bring to the signing of the agreement and other countries.</p><p>But the biggest and most anticipated conclusion — the provisions set out in the report, ""can become the basis for international debate"". And it's a strong move. Because Russia is already possible to hang all the dogs. Because it holds together with India the development of hypersonic Brahmos missile.<p><p>And then there is wide scope for action. You can even create an international organisation similar to that last year won the Nobel Peace Prize ""for his fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons"". And call it ""an international organization to fight World War III"". Well, or with Russia.</p><p>And the antigiperzvukovaja company, initiated by the United States, has already spread pretty far outside the offices of the Pentagon and serving the interests of research centres. It came to discuss the issue at the UN. In more radical terms. And it is understandable that the United States act as a locomotive in lobbying for this topic.</p><p>At the end of February at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the UN Secretary General <strong>Antonio</strong> Guterres spoke on this matter clearly.<p><p>He first worked for the American version concerning the activities of the ""White Helmets"": ""key components of the international architecture in the field of arms control crumble. The continued use of chemical weapons without proper punishment for what causes it to spread.</p><p>The Secretary General then started talking about the most decisive steps that should make all profile UN committees, as well as independent public organizations. ""Such actions should take into account the regional challenges in the field of nuclear safety, as well as technical development, including in the area of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and <strong>so-called Hypersonic weapons</strong>that can be used to attack unprecedented speed, ""said the UN Secretary-General.</p><p>It is understandable that the most resolute steps ""involve a legislative decision to ban Hypersonic weapons. It is still not ready, as from the date of this historic speech just a fortnight. Not connected to the movement and social organizations. Still ahead.<p><p>Ahead and extension or revision 3 of the start I Treaty, which expires in the year 2021. It is quite clear, on the basis of ""public opinion"", oonovskoe, the United States will try to make renewed and giperzvukovomu weapons restrictions.</p><p>But here's something not recall that before the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States made a proposal to the League of Nations to ban nuclear weapons. Because ""America first"".</p><p><strong>Military technology</strong>: the Pentagon is preparing a response ""German dagger"" and ""Cirkonu""</p>"
