Rods are key functional nuclear reactor sites; they come into contact with the uranium fuel and control the intensity of flow of nuclear reaction. The main problem of fast neutron nuclear reactor of the new generation, allowing reuse of spent uranium is serious loads experienced by these rods. Maximum working temperature membranes of fuel cells (Fuel) in the next-generation reactors reach 550-700° c, from the outside at a zhidkometallicheskij heat-sodium. Load generated significantly higher those that can withstand shell rods existing reactors. To close the nuclear fuel cycle in the fast breeder reactor of the new generation require new structural materials capable to ensure higher fuel burnup, compared with now. These materials must withstand the damaging radiation doses to sleep 180-200 (offsets on Atom), instead of the maximum 100-130 of sleep for existing materials. In such circumstances, shell cores made of steel, are simply not able to work.

' Could solve the problem by applying complex strain-thermal processing of three-layer blanks, including hot co-extrusion (pressing), radial forging and rolling. The result is the formation of a ' transitional ' zone on the border of the material components in which the materials diffuse one another that ensures high durability their connections ',-said Alexander Baranov. As reported by scientists as a result of the application of the technology of steel and vanadium alloy ' sprout ' each other.

Last year, Wall Street investors have invested in the sector is half that in 2016-m. as compared with 2012-m investment decreased by two thirds. Without money, slanceviki cut budgets and hoping for higher prices. However, as recently stated by BP's Chief Executive Robert Dudley, the industry is already nothing will help — because, he said, ' lack of brains '. What's wrong with shale oil market and why investors have turned away from him — in the material. In 2010-2014 years of technology development and high oil prices have led to explosive growth of investment in oil production in the shale deposits. But in the year 2015 fall dramatically black gold and slancevikam had to fight for survival. Failed about a hundred manufacturers, affected a total of more than 70 billion dollars. Because investment has become more difficult, companies to stay afloat, attracted equity, reducing costs. By improving production technologies in the year 2017 the market began to recover — and investment jumped by 60%. But the industry is still far from profitability. ' Thousands of shale wells drilled in the past five years, pump less oil and gas than their owners promised to investors — The Wall Street Journal said. Is called into question: whether the promising and profitable shale drilling, which link the hopes of turning the United States into the oil superpower? ' According to estimates by Norwegian energy consulting company Rystad Energy, the vast majority of American shale oil companies will be able to produce at least ten percent less oil and gas than projected. And in some regions lag exceeds 50%. among companies whose actual production is below forecasts, the two largest oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New York Mexico City — Pioneer Natural Resources and Energy of the Parsley. Now oil production in the United States reached a record 11.5 million barrels a day, largely thanks to slancevomu boom. However, as the WSJ notes, such high indicators of support is extremely difficult — operators need to drill more wells, which requires enormous costs. But lack of money: (c) October crude oil prices have fallen nearly 40%, expenditure is reduced and huge infusions of investors is not expected. Analysts have pointed out: during the ten years the industry has not lived up to expectations. According to the information of the consulting firm Evercore ISI, energy companies have spent during this period to 280 billion dollars more than it earned on the exploitation of oil and gas. ' Investors are tired of losing money. Many companies say: If the industry does not become more disciplined, they will not return, ""notes Todd Heltman, a senior analyst with the energy sector New York Neuberger Berman Group, one of the leading asset management firms, which owns shares of shale producers. In the opinion of experts, slanceviki fall into a vicious circle. The peculiarity of this industry is the rapid depletion of wells. Shortly after the completion of drilling in shale operations production drops sharply and the original speech performance no longer goes. To compensate, companies must increase the number of new wells that unrealistic without additional costs, notes the head of the oil services firm Schlumberger Paal Kibsgaard. But investors are reluctant to buy securities companies enhance their drilling budgets because growth of quotations in this case. An acute lack of investment has forced the company to revise the production plans. Already since December slanceviki entered the austerity, slashing budgets for the current year is the first time in several years. Major miners Centennial Resource Development, Diamondback Energy and Parsley Energy reduced planned expenditures by approximately 15 percent. cost reduction announced more than a dozen manufacturers. This is despite more than 20 percent growth in prices compared with December's minimums. Absolute dependence on oil quotations is one of the main problems of the oil shale industry. ' The United States is the only country where you respond to market signals, this is a market without a brain, ""he stated. When the WTI oil prices in the region of 57 dollars per barrel, even a slight increase in the cost of borrowing enough to some companies this year have lost their entire profit potential. ' To start new projects the WTI price should stay stable in the region of 60 dollars per barrel, ""said the head of one of the largest American oil companies Hess John Hess at the World Economic Forum in Davos. That is how much you want to slancevikam."

In Germany decided to take away the passports of those who willingly joined the ' Islamic State ' *. And British authorities have not let: her Majesty's Government denies citizenship even wives of jihadists. The truth is that such measures are not all like-there are objections as human rights activists, and ordinary citizens. And another to disputes about what to do with former jihadis, turned out to be, as always, the President of the United States was involved in Donald Trump. in Germany, the Interior Ministry and the Justice Ministry agreed to revoke the citizenship of former fighters IG * if they have reached the age of majority, participated in combat actions on the side of ' Caliphate ' (IG * supporters believe their grouping theocracy), as well as if they have, in addition to German, a passport of any country yet. Jihadis already serving term remain citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany. About this reported by German television stations and newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung ' thousands of foreign fighters, including from Germany, fighting on the side of the fighters ' Islamic State ' *. First they burned German passports before the cameras and declared themselves citizens of Caliphate — told journalists. Today many are detained in Iraqi and Kurdish camps in northern Syria and dream of returning home. &lt; ... &gt; Americans and Kurds urge to take them back. This is consistent with the principles of international law '. Sueddeutsche Zeitung described and the unenviable fate of German jihadists who do not manage to escape back home. ' Kurdish militias and so waged war with GAM * mostly alone. It would be wrong to leave them alone with prisoners ', reads the article. Just Syria and Iraq, according to official figures, left about a thousand German citizens. Third returned home, about 150 were killed. The rest were captured. When a rule in force, nor the media nor the authorities did not specify. Cautious officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice can understand. A similar tightening of laws necessarily criticisms, and defenders will certainly remind of the Third Reich, when deprived of the citizenship of Jews and dissidents. The Nazis seized the passport of the future even Chancellor Willy Brandt. To justify morally difficult decision, the authorities of the Federal Republic may have to cite as an example Australia. There fighters deny citizenship even with the 2015. Impetus to German law gave Donald Trump, which recently Europeans ' pick up their fighters from Syria '. Otherwise, he said, the Americans released them. The President of the United States noted that the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several other European States should prosecute more than 800 militant terrorist group IG *, captured in Syria. ' United States do not want to see fighters IG * penetrate into Europe. We do a lot and spend a lot. It's time for others to connect, ""Trump openly pressed German authorities. replied that it would be incredibly difficult to ' '. On the one hand, all German citizens have the right to return to their homeland. On the other hand, do not really understand how to conduct the investigation. Because witnesses would remain in the Middle East without an indictment will not be able to reach a verdict. Minister Horst Seehofer has put forward some conditions for repatriation. First, you need a file on each, and personal information you should check on the spot, before former jihadis will sit down on the plane, heading to Germany. In addition, Berlin must be sure that returning in no case threaten State security. But in general the way to his homeland jihadists no one closes. ' Strictly speaking, all German citizens, including those suspected of involvement in the fighting on the side of the so-called IG *, have a right to return, ""stressed the Ministry. I must say, in Europe not all responded to the call of the President of the United States. Denmark, for example, vehemently opposed to the return to the country of militants. Swedish Prime Minister Stephen Leven also said that the Kingdom is not thirsty to take back nationals who fought in the Middle East for IG *. The head of the Government noted that Stockholm some years warned owners of Swedish passports to travel to Syria. Earlier reluctance to see European jihadists in the old world and head of the French FOREIGN MINISTRY expressed Jean-Yves Le Drian. And the UK denied citizenship not only militants but also members of their families. In 2014-m London started with small, revoked the passports of those who have dual citizenship, as well as naturalized immigrants in the country who are fighting abroad. This caused criticism from Jurists, they cited the UN Convention from August 30, 1961 year signed including Britain London it did not stop. Moreover, passports became select and from relatives of the militants. In mid-February, was told that She would lose British nationality Begum, and erupted scandal. At the age of 15 years old girl along with two school friends, by deceiving parents, fled the country and joined the militants in Syria IG *. There she supposedly married for jihadi, who a few weeks ago was captured. Shameem Itself found in the refugee camp. Shortly before she gave birth to a son. Jihadi wife gave an interview to the British media, telling the ' shared some British values ' and wanted to go home. Perhaps it would go toward, if not for her other statements. As it turned out, she did not regret having joined the rebels, it was not at all troubled executions ' enemies of Islam '. And IG *, She lamented, ' not deserved the victory because they rule the ball corruption and oppression '. British authorities came to the conclusion that the young woman ' is still under the influence of ideology IG * and justify the atrocities of terrorists '. Native girl, who still live in Britain, appealed against the actions of the authorities. However, in the Government are sure not to violate the UN Convention, Because She has the right to a nationality of Bangladesh. In addition, in the UK the Nationality Act of 1981 year, whereby it may deprive ' if the Minister considers that it contributes to the public good, and this person will not remain as a result without any nationality generally ' true power ' native ' for Shamimy of Bangladesh stated that it will not be allowed to ' Jihad ' lioness in the country and in no case will give her a passport. Resourceful girl and her husband reported that then they will turn to the Dutch authorities about the nationality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Russian islamoved Roman Silantyev noted that ' rehabilitation of former fighters rarely returns them to normal life on the rather than in words. ' ' Even a drug addict more likely than jihadi, added the expert. -Some countries deny citizenship for it — Kazakhstan and Israel. The idea, in my opinion, correct: If people want to build an ' Islamic State ' *, let them build it in specially designed places. Actually the deprivation of citizenship is a humane measure. Nationality should be a privilege '. Akhunov Azat, Associate Professor of religious studies, recalled that ' the Maghreb countries — Morocco and Algeria — have long adopted such practices not allowed back those who stood on the path of Jihad '. ' Issue with militants-Islamists especially painful for Algeria, surviving the war with religious extremists. Even Saudi Arabia has adopted a law to prosecute those nationals who, as mercenaries, fought outside the Kingdom. Nobody wants to see human host pumped into all extremist ideas.

This can adversely affect brain health, write the scientists in the journal ACS Chemical Neuroscience. various psychedelic drugs, including LSD, were originally created for the treatment of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. In the second half of the last century ' acid ' quickly became a popular psychedelic substance among young people, which is why all such substances have been or are prohibited, or transferred under strict control by the State. In recent years, as noted by Olson, among medical and neuro-physiologists again arose interest in LSD and other psychedelic drugs. Watching how they act on the brain and animal volunteers, scientists study their work and evaluate the admissibility of their application in the midget doses does not cause hallucinations. For example, two years ago scientists from Switzerland showed that LSD affects special nerve cells, receptors are present on the surface kind of 5-HT2A. If their job lock, all effects from drug activity disappear. In turn, Olson and his colleagues figured out exactly how these neurons work is changing and how you can selectively suppress part of effects from receiving high doses of psychedelic drugs. in continuation of these experiments, the researchers tested how small doses (dimetiltriptamina DMT), another drug of its kind to affect the brain and behavior of several tens of normal rats. Some of them had suffered from mental disorders, while others managed to purchase animal equivalent ' Afghan ' syndrome. American neuroscientists have tried to suppress it by adding in the feeders and drinkers of rats is extremely small amounts of DMT, relevant approximately one tenth of the typical dose of this psychedelic, over the next two months. To their surprise, small doses of the substances affected the work rat brain is not as expected, researchers based on the results of their past experiences. Despite the fact that they are really weakened ' Afghan ' syndrome and depression, they do not have accelerated the growth of neurons and links between nerves, as is the case with large doses of DMT, and vice versa, caused them to atrophy. Interestingly, the character of the psychedelic noticeably varied for individuals of different genders. In particular, the neurons almost no males died from DMT, while among females the effect was pronounced, but they began to quickly gain weight. In addition, scientists have recorded no improvement in intellectual abilities of rats, as often they say supporters of these drugs, and fixed a lot of changes in the metabolism of the nerve cells."

Isurus can accelerate to 110 kilometers per hour during the spurt for prey because of the unique structure of their scales, forcing water to flow only in one direction along it. This is the conclusion of scientists who report to the Conference of the American physical society in Washington, DC. Sharks are among some of the most long-lived fish and just vertebrates on Earth. For example, the Greenland Shark Somniosus microcephalus live on average about two or three hundred years, and some individuals may live to age in 500 years, making them the most long-lived creatures on the planet. in addition to the records of longevity, the same shark among the most active and rapid underwater predators. It is well known that the Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) can sail with ' cruising ' speeds in 74 kilometers per hour and accelerate to 110 kilometers per hour at the moment when they see prey. Lang and her colleagues opened secret ' Super speeds ' of this kind of sharks by studying another unusual trait is the ability to ' vzeroshivat ' scales, change its angle plates, in some parts of their bodies. these layers ' biobroni ' sharks are arranged so that the predator can reject them aside from body to 30-40 degrees. Their surface remains smooth, if you look at the fish by the nose, and becomes similar to an open pine cone with reverse end. This ' variable geometry ' scales, as clarified Lang even 10 years ago, experimenting with artificial copies of the skin may improve mako shark body dynamics and help her to swim faster. Recently her team carried out experiments with real examples of scales and skin of these fish and checked how fair were those assumptions. to this end, scientists have created a special setup that allowed them to accurately measure the force flow disruption posed by samples of shark skin and other fragments of soft materials, and understand how they interact with streamlined and turbulent water flow in different conditions. these measurements have confirmed their original hypothesis and showed that the skin Mako really controls the movement of different types of flows of water in much the same way as do golf balls covered with lots of microscopic holes. They neutralize the disruption of flow when hitting the ball and allow him to fly at 30% farther than a sleek ball of the same mass and size."

Scientists from the United States figured out how you can make the usual laser beam to pass through dense fog or white walls, in a special way by changing the spatial structure of his impulses. ' Recipe ' for creating such laser installations was presented in the journal Nature Photonics. In recent years, scientists are actively working on creating gadgets that allow you to see through walls and peek to inaccessible corners of space. For example, in October 2015 year physics from MIT have learned to see through walls and see silhouettes of people, using the conventional WiFi transmitters and receivers, and their colleagues from Scotland created a camera capable of ' peeking around the corner. ' Tsao and her colleagues made another appliance This kind of ' teaching ' laser beam pass through fog and any other opaque objects, not absorbing and reflecting light as the beam of light particles interacted with a thin wall of white material. Scientists wondered what part of the photons all same seeps through such obstacles, while avoiding collisions with electrons during movement through the opaque and dispelling Wednesday, and the properties of the beam affect their number. For this jelskie of physics arranged two ultra-sensitive matrix behind sheets of pressed nanoparticles of zinc oxide, playing the role of the wall, and began to monitor how much light passed through its different sites. These experiences Cao and her team conducted using so-called spatial light modulator-a special optical device that allows flexible management of spatial structure of beams of electromagnetic waves. Its equivalents can be found in any projector and many scientific instruments. It turned out that spatial modulators may specify the form of a ray of light that it begins to pass through opaque objects. This will happen if its structure is in a certain way be the width of the original ' channels ' between the atoms and electrons, through which the light can freely move. This selection of parameters, as the researchers note, the laser beam ceased to dissipate, and his power grew in 4.5 times. Similarly, they said, it will behave not only in a collision with a wall, but with fog or other lenses Wednesday."

It is reported by the magazine Popular Science scientists compare this process with common in scientific circles about bayka frog in boiling water. Its essence is that accidentally caught in a saucepan with boiling water, amphibious instantly jump and not suffer. However, if you put a frog in a container with hot water, slowly she feels nothing and eventually perish. In relation to the perception of climate change, this means that humanity unknowingly stops to assess them as anomalies and unrepentent about their possible adverse effects. According to experts, memory fixes only limited periods of time. Thus, in assessing the climatic variations, people compare them only to have occurred during the past period changes and cease to perceive them as abnormal, said the work of the scientific team analyzed more than two million messages to Americans in social networks, made from 2014-2016 year. They all dealt with the weather. Scientists these publications related to climatic indicators in the period. It turned out that due to regular reps weather events people stopped noticing them. ' and after eight years, the relevance and visibility of these changes quite reduced and you no longer consider them notable ', says one of the study's authors Frances Moore of the University of California. At times due to the scarcity of human memory, people may perceive an anomaly as the norm. For example, due to global warming from a historical perspective, normal winter temperatures are seen as extremely low. The researchers also analyzed the emotions of users of social networks within a specified period of time, to find out climate anomalies cause negative reactions. Scientists came to the conclusion that the mood of the people still varies due to weather: even ignoring climate change, humanity can not fully adapt to them."

It is reported by the press-service of the American Academy of Neurology. In recent years, scientists are finding more hints that obesity not only increases the strain on the skeleton, promotes problems with metabolism and is one of the causes of diabetes, but also negatively affects other parts of the body. For example, recently scientists from the United States found that overweight women contributes to relapse of breast cancer, as well as accelerates the aging brain and induces changes in its work. On the other hand, recent European and American doctors found some unexpected pluses from excess weight. In particular, it became clear that his owners discernable survive, getting into the intensive care unit with severe infectious diseases. In addition, they live markedly longer after diagnosis of heart failure than other cores. Liu and her colleagues came to the conclusion that something similar for strokes, taking care about the fate of thousands of elderly California residents emerging from severe bleeding in the brain. Dividing them into five groups according to the level of obesity, scientists for three months and watched how fast was to recover them. As it turned out, the extra weight of very favourable influence on the health of their wards. Most obese patients, Liu and her team died at 62% less often than victims of strokes with normal weight.

Geologists have come to this conclusion based on long-term observations. This led to the proposal of Russia at the UN about extending continental shelf through deep sea territory, rich in oil and gas deposits in the mid twentieth century, Marine geologists have discovered giant mountains encircling the planet on the bottom The world's oceans. They were called mid-ocean ridges. In the 1960-ies expressed hypothesis that they originated on the ground ruptures of lithospheric plates, places where new crust is formed soon confirmed the hypothesis of geophysics, opened in rocks ocean floor contrails of the magnetic field of the planet. Different magnetized sites found in the area is the mountain uplift Gakkel Ridge in the western part of the Arctic Ocean. It is said that this place lithospheric plates are broken and between them rises from the depths of the melt. Gakkel Ridge gap began approximately 53 million years ago. Extent of the plates in this place continues to this day with a speed of a few millimeters a year. Earlier, 65 million years ago, the North American continent became relegated from Eurasia, dispersed Alaska and Chukotka. About then and hollows that form now the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean, as well as raising the Mendeleyev and Lomonosov Ridge. Based on geophysical measurements in the German research vessel ' Polarstern ' in 1991 year, scientists speculated that both underwater mountain ridge once belonged to the Eurasian continent. Lomonosov Ridge stretches approximately 1700 kilometers from Novosibirsk Islands where its width reaches two hundred kilometers across the North Pole to Greenland and Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Archipelago, where mountain ridge narrows to four times and ends with saddle depth of 2.4 kilometres. Virtually all geological data — Russian and foreign — indicates that the region East of the Gakkel Ridge, including the raising of Mendeleev, is part of the Eurasian continental shelf. Why is it so important? The fact is that, according to the UN Convention on the law of the sea of 1982, which Russia ratified in a zone of economic interests of the countries bordering the Arctic Ocean, is composed of two hundred nautical miles from the borders of territorial waters or 150 miles from the border continental shelves. If you prove that the Russian continental shelf includes the Lomonosov Ridge, Russian border move at 350 miles through the Arctic Ocean. This is a 1.2 million square kilometers of rich hydrocarbons marine sediments, which are estimated at five billion tons of equivalent fuel. Russia filed an application to the UN at the expansion of Arctic boundaries even in the year 2001, but its not approved, considering the scientific evidence is inconclusive. New application with current data from marine expeditions presented in the year 2015. It examined at several meetings, the decision is not made. In the year 2014 the UN supported Russia and acknowledged sea of Okhotsk inland. As a result, the territory of the country increased by 52 thousand square kilometers at the end of February, it became known that the UN Sub-Commission appreciated the new Russian request, as well as waiting for similar documents from Canada and Denmark are also competing for expansion economic zones of influence in the Arctic. Meanwhile, a recent article by Russian scientists from VNIIokeangeologii and Saint Petersburg State University summarizes the multi-year geological surveys in the Arctic Ocean. Composition and structure of the Lomonosov Ridge rocks very similar to those that scientists can see at the bottom of the Barents and Kara Seas — under a layer of sediment resting ancient continent, established long before the ocean here. Actually, the Lomonosov Ridge is a snub to system faults the land area. He was land another ten-thirteen million years ago."

He was a court stihotvorcem Anna Ioannovna (not by State and by fate). Tell a joke, often at up to Empress his od poet must have been from the doors of the Hall to the throne to crawl on their knees. Piit courtier. During the reign of Anna Ioannovna it was almost clown post. But Vasily Trediakovsky studied in Holland and Paris, knew several languages, he studied philosophy and mathematics in February 1740 years for entertainment Empress in St. Petersburg was built the famous Ice House for Jester's wedding Kvasnika-Avdotej Buzheninovoj golitsin . For masquerade took verses, and Cabinet Minister Artemy Volynsky, which was the organizer of this event, called Trediakovsky. Sent him Cadet announced that his luck poet in the ' Cabinet of her Imperial Majesty '. Vasily trediakovsky scared-he thought it up in the Office of secret and intelligence Affairs, which in common parlance were called ' Cabinet ' or ' Stukalovym ' order. Word and deed! With these jokes were bad ... But learn along the way that it is not taken in the ' Cabinet ', and to the Cabinet Minister, Trediakovsky became the Cadet to blame that evil entered with him, announcing that lucky in the ' Cabinet ': ' he's such a declaration could man and life deny '. Cadet once complained to Volyn. And that neither the last beat a poor poet. For what? It was unclear. Perhaps, just stigmatized was influential ... ! Trediakovsky decided to lodge a formal complaint about the beating. Bore her directly to favorite Anna Ioannovna Duke of Biron. And, as luck, ran into the reception with Volyn! He grabbed piita scruff and ordered to plant it under guard. Vasily Trediakovsky himself so wrote about it: ' by insulting me in every way, told ... beat palkoju on bare back so cruelly and nemilostivo ... given to me with seventy blows ... ', then ' packs told me to throw to the ground and beat even by the same palkoju, so given to me and then with thirty-times '. Later the Cabinet-Minister come on guardhouse and ordered he just visited sentries again beat Trediakovsky-' still palkoju ten times that and uchineno '. And after execution of a teenager the poet released ' threats '. Biron, who has long been with Volyn ' in kontrah ', learned about the incident and asked the Empress with a request to punish Cabinet Minister. Moreover, a performance he arranged the favourite Anna Ioanovna, at the end of which the raised rib-or I or he. Artemy Volynsky eventually tried and chopped off his head. But, of course, his severe punishment had nothing to do with beating them Trediakovsky. Just Biron found that his foster dared grab supplicant, an assault on his authority. Vasily Kirillovich still waited for reward ' for ignominy and injury ': he issued the annual salary-360 rubles. That is, it turns out that the poet such as paid a premium for ' overtime ' work. By the way, despite the beatings, the wedding shutovskuju he wrote a very funny, hilarious and frivolous poems. creativity Trediakovsky had always been a lot of controversy. And already during his life it seemed antiquated. And after the publication of the Trediakovskim in the year 1766 ' Telemahidy ' free ' translation of the adventures of Telemachus ' Fénelon-he even became an object of ridicule. In the comic ' the Hermitage ' etiquette Empress Catherine II was punishable for a small guilt: ' if anyone prostupitsja, you should drink a glass of cold water and read the page ' Telemahidy ' Trediakovsky '. In the history of Vasily Trediakovsky remained as talentless stihotvorec, furious and largely unfair critic and ponositel Lomonosov and Sumarokov. Although Pushkin put his creativity very much: ' ... the study brings more benefit Trediakovsky, rather than studying other our old writers '. And speaking of Trediakovskom, many remember the verse: Imperatriks Ekaterina! Went to Tsarskoe Selo! For example, Andrey Voznesensky admired this dvustishiem, seeing the ' Oh! ' mirror, mirror, in which the Empress's before going in The Palace Ensemble Tsarskoe Selo. But actually it is not a verse, and Trediakovsky parody of himself and his work. Its author is considered Gabriel Romanovich Derzhavin. And the word ' artsy ' imperatriks Trediakovsky really once pasted in his Odes, and, as so often happened with him, amassed because of this big trouble. Opus begins as follows: ' long live the Virgin Anna imperatriks '. However, the word ' imperatriks ' seemed suspicious Scrivener, spiritual reign, and he told of how his superiors. Fire case: ' in the title of her Imperial Majesty was published not in form '. The thing about just in the Office of secret and intelligence Affairs, ' Cabinet '. Trediakovsky was uneasy, and wrote extensive exculpatory explanation: ' I Used this Latin word, Imperatriks, for that measure of the verse of this required; but through his word that there is nothing in the highest damage of her Imperial Majesty tittle (letters), then don't put it quite opravlivaet me language Latianskij, but beyond that and yet poetic science '. At its happiness, this explanation reasonable was recognized investigators. That's all that you can briefly say about Vasily Kirilloviche Trediakovskom. He was buried in St. Petersburg on Smolensk cemetery. However, it is impossible to worship him is the long-lost Tomb. The poet was poor, and, most likely, his grave was placed a simple wooden cross that had rotted and eventually turned into dust. ' Because the dust and to dust you will '."

Pancake week starts today — in the people it is celebrated with pancakes and massive festivals. The holiday lasts all week: according to the Orthodox dogma, these days getting ready for lent, but from the point of view of tradition — see off the winter. How to properly celebrate Pancake Day and whether to do so at all — versed RIA News. For a relatively short period after decades of State atheism Carnival again became a truly national holiday: it is difficult to find in Russia family, where at that time not be baked pancakes. Although almost a century Soviet power by all means tried to erase from the memory of the folk custom of the associated ' with a religious sense of inebriation and bourgeois remnants. ' Carnival is really determined by the Orthodox calendar. A week before the great lent is a period of very strict abstinence — starts week ' dead ', or ' cheese week. ' the name speaks for itself: Church Charter bids already at this time to renounce meat. But the eggs and all the milk (' cheese ') products, eat as much as you like, to the post, which this year begins March 11. ' on mjasopustnoj week worship varies significantly: Wednesday and Friday there is the liturgy of these days already operates Lenten Charter. That is, it's such a ' buffer ' between ' rabid ' and lent. And the meaning is very simple: a person has a certain internal inertia, it is given a week to facilitate entry into the post space, very stressful, ""says RIA News head of the Department of theology of the Moscow Theological Academy Archpriest Pavel Velikanov. around the 15th century in Russia this preparatory week in liturgical books referred to as the ' oil ' zagovenem, and her last day of ' maslopustom ' — from that point until Easter prohibits not only meat, but also dairy food. So even the name ' Carnival ' is partly to do with Christianity. By the way, the Soviets studiously avoid this word and even revived in 1960-ies of the last century the feast itself, officially named his ' Wires Russian winter '. ' Winter is nothing less than a large pagan funeral: we still call a funeral ' wires '. So here's the Carnival is a great trizna-goddess of winter, which overcomes the spring ', explains in an interview with RIA Novosti the high priest of Slavic communities Union native faith Vadim Kazakov. Fisticuffs, pole climbing, burning effigies of winter — in all this pagan meaning. For example, post, according to Kazakov, symbolizes known many beliefs of the ' tree of the universe ', and the pancake is after fights. ' When the Prince died at his funeral were fighting until the blood and sometimes to death. In the Chronicles says: ' borjahus before dead ', that is, before the coffin of the deceased, ""said Kazakov. And burning effigies and does goes back to the widespread of ancient Indo-European peoples have traditions of worship fire water purification. Its flame is also the main symbol of Spring Festival Nowruz, Turkic peoples. that's Carnival is directly connected with the meeting in the spring. Ulterior motive Slavs celebrated this feast at the end of March is the day of the vernal equinox. Yes and the name was completely different, rising to one of the pagan rituals: first baked pancake Slavs before you eat, special cheers dedicated prashhuram. But, as the saying goes, the first pancake is always lumpy, hence the Komoedica.  Generally speaking, today most importantly hold pancakes place among oil tradition, if for the sake of them all and deal. The Pancake week this dish appears around diversity. No wonder famous Russian writer Ivan Shmelev said, exactly what the friggin asked the mood around the holiday. And yet popularly believed that pancake symbolizes the Sun is the main attribute of the spring. Indeed, than no reason for joy?! But it turns out pancakes was originally diametrically opposite meaning. ' They were beyond dish. Unlike the present, secondary. The principal on the table was a brushwood (thin cookies, reminiscent of the tree branches. -Prim. Ed.) ', — underlines the priest Vadim Kazakov.  In General, the rites of Carnival with pre-Christian times have been preserved in its original form by about 80 percent, says the representative pagan community. Goes, Carnival today is purely a pagan holiday? Why, then, not only treated to pancakes visitors of fairs, but also, for example, congregants of Orthodox temples? Really deviate from faith? In fact, everything depends on how you treat the Carnival — as a cultural phenomenon or how to have sacred meaning rituals, said Archpriest Pavel Velikanov.  ' For example, Orthodox Greece there is such tradition: good week were conducted (last week before Easter. — ed.) in the courtyards of the temples to burn an effigy of Judas. It is clear that there are common roots with the burning of effigies of winter we have. There is a logical question: why burn? If we treat this as a custom sekuljarnomu to anything we are not correct, is one thing. If we turn in a ' thread ', which begin to pull and thereby engage in reconstruction of pagan action is quite another, ""explains priest.  That is, from the point of view of the Church, if Carnival does not carry ' charge ' antihristianskogo, there is nothing bad in the Festival. Importantly, reminiscent of a theologian, not to forget about the approaching of lent."
