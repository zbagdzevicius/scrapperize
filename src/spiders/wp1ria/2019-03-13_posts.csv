The participants of the World Championship on memory for fifteen minutes learn a random set of three hundred text elements. Innate ability here at anything, say scientists. Memory performance and speed of memorizing can be trained, if you approach the case wisely. At the end of the year 2016, scientists from the Netherlands, Germany and the United States trained five dozen volunteers, ranging in age from 24 to 27 years to memorize the sequence of 72 words. Participants were divided into three groups. The first coached the short term memory. The second studied by the method of so-called lokusnoj workout: list items — in this case, the word is connected with the certain place, focusing on which people could correctly reproduce the sequence. Volunteers from third team did nothing. They performed in as a control group. Before the training, the participants could remember about 25-30 words from 72. After six weeks of intensive training, the volunteers of lokusnoj methodology correctly reproduced on average 35 words more than ever before. Those who tried to improve short term memory, vyuchivali in 11 words more, and members of the control group — about five words, four months later, during which there was no training, volunteers again asked to pass these tests. And again the best results showed those who used the lokusnyj approach. Memory performance increased by about 22 words compared with the level at the beginning of the study. The first group have no difference with the original indicators was not, and that's from someone who is not trained to memorize new words, results have worsened. Brain Scan study participants showed that those who were able to significantly improve your memory, have changed the functional relationship between the neurons: they became stronger. It is made up of two divisions of the brain — the medial prefrontal cortex, which is activated when people relate new knowledge already acquired, and right dorsolateralnoj part of the prefrontal cortex, which is a substrate of short-term memory. Memory can be improved and regular physical exercise, showed the work of British and Dutch scientists. They asked volunteers to remember the association between images and location of labels on a computer screen and reproduce them from memory. The next day the test repeated the best results showed those participants who engaged in the sport through four hours after the first stage of the experiment. Exercise performed immediately after memorising material, significant impact on memory performance is not provided. The authors of the study suggest that sport increases the production of norepinephrine and dopamine. These neurotransmitters stimulate the activity of the hippocampus is a plot of the brain, playing a key role in the formation of long-term memories from short-term memory. According to a study by scientists from the University of Exeter (United Kingdom), people, upotrebivshie alcohol after training, remember information better sober researchers asked 88 people aged from 18 to 54 years of age who are not abusers of alcohol, learn a few dozen words that were similar to the present, but kept the extra letters. Then the subjects were tested to assess the number of memorized items. After this part of the volunteers allowed within two hours to drink so much touch hot as they saw fit. The next day, all participants in the blood alcohol level measured and were asked to take the test again. Among the leaders by the number of points scored were those who on the eve of the hearing. And the more it subjects in the body per mil, the better was the result of the test. Scientists explain this effect possible influence of alcohol on the processes occurring in the brain during sleep. Although State that is just a guess. The more rats having sex, the better they work the hippocampus, found u.s. scientists from Princeton University. In humans, this area of the brain plays a key role in memorizing words. Transfer the results of rodent experiments on people, but there is some correlation, at least for women. Canadian researchers found that representatives of the fair sex, a lot of time with love pleasures, better at remembering abstract words. And here's a memory for faces of frequency does not depend on sex, because it meets the other Division of the brain. After 50 years of having sex are equally good effect on memory, regardless of sex. According to the Australian psychologist Mark Allen, frequent sex helps elderly maintain memory at a higher level."

Their description was presented in the journal of Knowledge and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems. In recent years, scientists have begun to actively discuss the panspermii hypothesis is the idea that life on Earth or other planets could be entered from space. It was invented in 1903 by the famous Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, but until recently no one considered seriously. The situation changed after experiments on board the Russian Bion series of ' biosputnikov-m ', in practice proven survival of microbes in a meteorite falling to Earth. In addition, American scientists have shown that the fossilized remains of life on earth could be ' knocked out ' from the surface of the Earth asteroids and be thrown into space, where they in the past, reaching for the Moon, Mars and other planets. Similar experiences, as well as the discovery of traces of potentially habitable Lakes on Mars make scientists wonder about the conditions in which extraterrestrial creatures might live and what is necessary for their survival. Among the candidates for the role of such ' aliens ' are considered so-called halophiles are a small group of microbes and multicellular creatures, able to live in conditions of extremely high salinity and the permanent lack of moisture. Shadrin and his colleagues discovered three species with such ' supersposobnostju ' by conducting a kind of census among various living creatures that live in salt lakes of Crimea. They asked what group of organisms adapted to a similar ' alien ' Wednesday and the molecular mechanisms that allow them to live in it. in total, over four hundred scientists collected zooplankton samples, small invertebrates animals and algae found in the various reservoirs of the peninsula, and made sure What salt concentration they might transfer. the attention of biologists attracted motyli, chironomus larvae, which can be found in almost every salty lake of Crimea. When they measured their resistance to salt, they found that three types of these insects is Baeotendipes noctivagus, Cricotopus sylvestris and Tanytarsus mendax, can live in very strong brine. the first type of mosquitoes, scientists found, generally turned out to be the record in this regard is a its larvae are able to dwell in the 30% solution of salt that is comparable with the level of salinity of the dead sea, Lake Baskunchak and many other ' alien ' bodies of water on Earth. Motyli two other types of slightly inferior to him in this regard. Further study of these mosquitoes, scientists hope, will help them uncover secrets their survival at such a strong brine. This will help not only to understand where and how life can exist outside of Earth, but start using motylej like the mosquito as a source of pure feed for fish, which by definition will not be eggs and larvae of the parasite."

Scientists from Russia, Switzerland and the United States forced the quantum computer back for a fraction of a second into the past ' ' violating the second law of thermodynamics. Their conclusions and possible manifestation of this effect in the real world was presented in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. One of the pillars of modern physics and Cosmology is the concept of the so-called ' boom time '-postulate that time in our universe moves exclusively in one direction, from the past to the future. In other words, we move through the four-dimensional space exclusively in one direction along the time axis, and ' rewind ' it back it is impossible from the point of view of physics, this is reflected in the fact that over time the anarchic, chaotic universe State that scientists call entropy, is growing steadily. For example, this process is reflected in the changing state of the energy Universe. This principle, which scholars often referred to as the ' second law of thermodynamics ', is considered the inviolable rule governing the life of the entire universe at all levels. It is also the reason why ' perpetual motion machine ' will always be only dream of science fiction writers and will never become a reality. Treefolk three years ago and his colleagues found that the second law of Thermodynamics can be violated at the quantum level, actually trying to prove otherwise. This paved the way for a quantum analogue of the famous ' Maxwell's demon ' is a hypothetical substance, fast and slow sorting molecules. Later Russian physicists have successfully implemented this idea in practice. This has forced them to think about whether it is possible to take advantage of the amazing properties of the quantum world and Maxwell's demon smash into several parts, separated by relatively large distances. They have implemented this ambitious task at the end of last year. The logical continuation of these experiments, as noted by the Treefolk, became checking whether time spontaneously turn into reverse at least one particle, whose the behavior of the control laws of quantum physics. For this purpose, they weighed whether the electron located in empty space, spontaneously go back for a moment back in time using the Schrödinger equation to estimate where at a particular time will be a particle. These calculations were based on a simple idea-the position of the particles will gradually ' to be smeared on space, subject to action ' arrowhead ' time. As it turned out, the electron can really be spontaneously in the past, returning to the State He had a couple of moments ago. Such developments, however, should happen extremely rarely-according to calculations the Kobold and his colleagues, this may happen about once for all time of the existence of the universe, and time will be ' just ' back at the seeked 0.06 nanoseconds. Nevertheless, the the possibility of such a violation of the second laws of thermodynamics has allowed Russian and foreign scientists to carry out such an operation ' manually ' using the cloud quantum computer firm IBM. Combining two or three kubita, basic modules and memory of such machines, scientists have filled their specific set of numbers and began to manipulate their content so that the level of chaos inside the quantum the system began to grow rapidly. When entropy has reached a certain point, the work of qubits start manage another program which has translated them into such a State that further ' evolution ' get-go not towards chaos and order. As a result, the qubits momentarily returned to its original state. Such a procedure, as pointed out by physics, success is not always managed to do in 80% of cases for two memory cells, and only half the attempts for three qubits. This is how researchers, has been associated with errors in the work of the quantum computer, rather than with some other completely unexpected and inexplicable reasons."

The results of their experiments were presented in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences. The human body and other multicellular beings developed over millions of years of evolution of the many mechanisms that protect it from the accumulation of mutations in the cells and destruction of potential ' pioneers ' tumors before they have time to multiply. For example, some immune Taurus can purposefully ' include ' in other cells of the chain of genes responsible for the initiation of a programme of self-destruction, if they suspect that they pose a threat to the organism and can turn into cancer. Today molecular biologists are actively looking for methods that would forcibly run these genetic ' instructions ' in cancer cells that would ' destroy ' tumors, pure not using chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Especially high hopes, as the press-service of the Institute for theoretical and experimental biology of RAS, Pushchino, scientists pinned on protein TRAIL, highly selective ' killer ' cancer cells, acting on one of these chains genes associated with ' death receptors DR4 and DR5. ' Its artificial analogue of izTRAIL proved in experiments with cultures of tumor cells in test tubes, but not acted on real tumors during clinical trials. In addition, later scientists discovered that some cultures of cancer cells are rapidly becoming invulnerable for his actions, and when experiments. Roman outside the body Faddeev, head of laboratory at the INSTITUTE of THEORETICAL and EXPERIMENTAL BIOPHYSICS RAS, and his colleagues found out what it was due, and made a big step for the establishment of an effective anti-cancer medications on the basis of izTRAIL, observing the interactions of its molecules and various cultures of cancer cells and experimenting on mice deprived of its own immune system. These experiences have shown that the strength of the protein-'killera ' on cancer cells greatly depended not only on the intrinsic properties of tumor cells, but also how big the population density was ' ' in test tubes and how they were closely located to each other. This led them to believe that cancer cells can acquire invulnerability to the effects of the protein due to its distinctive ' collective ' protection that prevents the work of izTRAIL molecules. Guided by this idea, scientists have tested what would happen if you handle such a culture is not pure protein-'killerom ', a combination of izTRAIL and small amounts of two other anti-cancer molecules of sorafenib and iRGD impeding ' communication ' tumor cells. These substances do not have electoral nature of izTRAIL action, but even their small doses are safe for the body of mice and men, weakened the protection of cancer cells to the point that they become vulnerable to the action of a protein-'killera ' as shown. experiments Fadzeeu and his colleagues, their mixture could slow growth or destroy tumors implanted in mice, the body to which the net izTRAIL not acted in any safe doses. As a result, the amount of tumor by the end of the experiment was about three times less than in mice in the control group."

Folklorist and anthropologist, researcher Nikita Petrov, Russian RIA Novosti News Agency, explained how these stories occur and why they frighten not only children. Urban horror stories that students tell each other in companies, camps, trips around the campfire, exploring with 1960 's. Earlier in the villages of horror stories were circulated with the sorcerers and witches. In many cultures there are similar. But apparently, known set of stories (about the red hand, piano black, blue or black tights and so on) is an invention of Soviet times. In the mid-20th century folklorists began their record and study. The 1990 years of oral creativity came in portrait form-writer Eduard Uspenskiy gathered stories about coffins on wheels, green, striped legs, red gingerbread and the like, under the one cover. Scary stories are very similar in structure. The main schemes of a few. Character or object type appears in the House and on a child or family threatened. Or if a child falls into a dangerous space where there is a character-wrecker. When telling this story in a camp in the House or around the campfire, gain credibility: do you know what all will end. And scaring the other, become a leader. At one time the same Eduard Uspenskiy so explained the origins of these stories. In the country — total information control, media published only ideologically adjusted texts. But through the conversations of adults in the World Kids leaking information is very different and sometimes transformed into horror stories. Here is the standard story about a family in a communal apartment. Dad went to work and never came back. Mom went to work — and has not returned. The first thing that comes to mind is the repression that so experienced and prozhivajutsja child. From the same series — stories about black car which goes through the city and takes children. Here you can remember that very many Soviet children in music schools not by their will. Apparently, this was one of the factors contributing to the emergence of stories on piano, with each key is a small needle. A separate category — stories, related to the development of children of the adult world. Mom buys the first daughter tights, and she complains about my mother on the way to kindergarten, that feet hurt. Mom does not pay attention. And in the evening, when the House girl takes off tights under them instead of the normal legs ' only the bones '. That is, mastering the world adults (tights-the subject of adult life) comes through overcoming fear. Marina Pavlovna Cherednikova, one of the first monsters are, said: ' when a child first thinks about death, he could not answer questions about why we die, what happens next with the body. And perhaps these stories — such a collective response to difficult questions '. For example, the boys went in old House, where a maniac from the movie ' Saw ' or a robot who all kills. Information field is now wider, children use different sources. There were other options for bullying — already older. For example, feared the policeman, Gipsy. Frightened and so: ' go out into the street with a wet head-get lice '. Through fear the indoctrinated children's standards of conduct. Sometimes the fears are transformed into a moral panic, which covers adults. One of the outbreaks was in 1957 year after the Festival of youth and students. Another — in the days when the Olympics in Moscow also had a lot of foreigners. In 1980-m jeans were a deficit. So, it was rumoured that some foreign pests hide in seams of cotton products boxes with lice. Wear jeans — get lice. It is interesting that in the 1990-ies parazitirovala yellow press on such rumours, and reprinted these fantastic stories ogromnymi tirazhami. Form of existence of monsters has changed, but the essence remained the same. My fellow anthropologists These groups have infiltrated disguised as participants tried to understand what was happening there. As it turned out, mostly so the kids of senior classes have established some form of control over the younger students. But panic gripped so that teachers in the meetings told about the dangers of the game, even those children who knew nothing about it. This is discussed by parents in chat rooms. Then everything went into decline, however, after a while a new moral panic based on another legend: foreigners specially distribute children chewing gum or candy with banned substances."
