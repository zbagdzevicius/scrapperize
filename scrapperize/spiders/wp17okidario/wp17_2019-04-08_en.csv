A mixture of lower passions of the human being that will result in a<strong> murder where the backdrop is the mythical Egyptian River.</strong></p><p>A couple separated by adverse circumstances and some newlyweds who embark on the adventure of their lives, whose tragic end will have to unravel a handsome detective who is charged to the shoulders the difficult task of solving a crime.

Have you felt any pressure?</strong></p><p><strong>Pablo Puyol:</strong> Well, pressure Yes, always, all the time. Whenever you get to a stage you feel pressure, and if over you are playing a classic and a writer as well known as Agatha Christie and in a theatre so iconic and surrounded by a cast like this, maybe a little more.</p><p><strong>Adriana Torrebejano:</strong> It is a respect really make a classic like this on a stage. As they are the things, ten actors on a stage is a meritazo.<p><p><strong>L: work is set on a cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt in the 1930s and overflowing elegance. What has become os easier and more difficult to get in the situation?</strong></p><p><strong>A.:</strong> It is true that although the work is set in the 1930s, with the contemporary version that has made Victor Conde, the elegance of the upper class of the moment is reflected, but it's still all very close to the public. I don't feel very at the time.</p><p><strong>P.P:</strong> The function has wanted to bring the classic Agatha Christie to the present time, give you an aura of modernity, make it more close to the present day, through clothing, the music, the scenery... without changing the text already in itself is magnificent.</p><p><strong>L: How did the project to your hands?</strong></p><p><strong>A.:</strong> Victor Conde and Alain Cornejo called my agent saying that they had this project between hands and wanted to count on me for one of the protagonists of the work and the truth is that made me very happy because I told him that it was very fan of Agatha Christie and that he was wishing that they offered me the role of Jacqueline de Severac which was one of my favorites. And it was indeed for that.<p><p><strong>P.P:</strong> My case was a little more rough because it was performing another function and the former actor who was going to make this character at the end could not and two weeks before the premiere, they called me and offered me and I accepted. In two weeks I prepared it and the other colleagues helped me a lot and in the end, it was much easier than painting.</p><p>Adriana Torrebejano: ""perhaps I able to provide Jacqueline my bad temper. ""She's very earthly, I also.""</p><p><strong>L: what you have contributed your characters and what you have brought to them?</strong></p><p><strong>A.:</strong> I always liked the character of Jacqueline. Many years ago I read the play and seemed to be a very intelligent woman, with lots of character, very engaged in pain, in that rage that gives you love. Perhaps I have been able to give my bad temper. She is very earthly, I also.<p><p><strong>P.P:</strong> In the theatrical version is not Hércules Poirot, but that is a detective, in fact at the beginning it was a priest, but decided to remove. As cure would have been a little roll 'Bird Hawthorn'. I think that I've brought a little more than sensuality to the character, maybe for my physical, because we are accustomed to seeing one older Poirot and other types of physical. And me me is providing much in terms of being more aware of what makes each person because on stage I spend all function by analyzing every little thing they do. I think that that character has given it me.</p><p><strong>L: how is the host of the public being?</strong></p><p>P.P.: Very good in general. Being a proposal so interesting, modern and different. There's an audience that did not expect to see an Agatha Christie in this way which is enjoying it much.<p><p>A.T.: I believe that this version is attracting more young people to see this classic.</p><p>Pablo Puyol: ""this character I is providing much in terms of being more slope of what makes each person, because on stage I spend all function by analyzing every little thing they do.""</p><p><strong>L: the two have worked in theatre, film and television. What do you prefer?</strong></p><p><strong>P.P:</strong> I with all three. Although the film like a little less because it is slower and I like to go fast.</p><p><strong>A.T.:</strong> Cinema I would like more, is made with more delicacy, is thought more, on TV everything goes very fast, which is good because it keeps you active and makes you learn, but cinema is made with so much love that then leave amazing things. And the theater is feedback so direct that it is to throw yourself into the pool in each function.</p><p><strong>L: what you say you</strong> the people that come to see the work?<p><p><strong>P.P:</strong> If you want to see a classic refurbished and changed and wearing other clothes and accompanied by wonderful music, with some incredible actors on stage and above all enjoy a nice Theatre evening as... that what they're doing that they have not been already.</p><p><strong>L: a dream that you comply?</strong></p><p>A.: all. Every day I have new desires, not just professional. In this profession you always want to grow and want to do more and have new challenges.</p><p><strong>Death on the Nile: Theatre Amaya</strong></p>"

I have always been so open with you all about my family, fitness, Mommy... and I don't want to keep this from you, just because it isn't as positive and shiny as the rest. I think it's important to show the truth... because my job is to help people by being real and open. Furthermore, I have no shame or embarrassment with this experience. I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester. This works for some, but I personally find it to be exhausting. I'm nauseous, tired, my body is changing. And I have to pretend that everything is just fine-and it truly isn't. I don't want to have to pretend anymore. I hope you understand. So, this is what is going on now: the embryo has a heartbeat, but it isn't strong, and the baby isn't growing very much. So we wait-and this is hard. So much uncertainty... but the chances are very, very small that this is a viable pregnancy. I have complete confidence that my family and I will get through this, even if the journey is difficult. I am so blessed with my amazing doctor, my dear friends, and my loving family... My husband and my four very healthy babies help me keep it together and have the perspective of how truly beautiful life is, even when it occasionally seems ugly. The luck and gratitude I feel that I am my babies' mommy, is wonderfully overwhelming and comforting. In your comments, please be kind. I'm feeling a bit fragile and I need support.
