There is no prohibition or standard that determines that the<strong> Duchess of Sussex</strong> may not wear these pieces. In recent days it has generated much controversy around the jewelry of the<strong> British Crown</strong> and the alleged prohibition that<strong> Queen Isabel </strong>has imposed on the spouse of<strong> Prince Harry </strong>on certain parts and that would have caused the anger the Duke of Sussex.</p><p>A controversy that comes from afar, particularly from the time of the link of the Dukes, last May. Apparently, at that time, the exactriz asked use a tiara with emeralds, which Isabel II refused and finally chose the filigree of the Queen Mary tiara.</p><p>If this were not enough, Meghan also obtained a refusal by his father-in-law when he wanted to wear tiara on his trip to the Antipodes, but Prince Charles told her that it was not appropriate to make a display of ostentation due to the economic situation of countries that came to visit. Interestingly, the same day that Meghan was denied the possibility of wearing a tiara in Fiji, Kate dazzled London with one of the bows that are most associated with <strong>Diana of Wales</strong>.<p><p>These two 'incidents' have increased the controversy about the difference in treatment between Kate and Meghan.

A rule that would affect other royals minor in the same way.</p><p>However, this statement would not be entirely truthful. Sources close to <strong>Buckingham</strong> confirm that it is not of course, that the Queen has made no prohibition to the<strong> Duchess of Sussex</strong>. In fact, already were provided to Meghan earrings of the Queen in her first public event with Isabel II.<p><p>What happens in reality is that there has been no occasion in which the Duchess of Sussex has had to wear pieces of special relevance, which Yes has taken place in the case of Kate Middleton, whose official agenda has been more intense in recent weeks due to the r ECTA end of pregnancy of Markle.</p><p class='mol-para-with-font'>We must remember that the use of tiaras is limited to married women and acts of great formality from 18:00 hours, since before other types of headgear or hats should be used. If you consider that there are only two weeks for Meghan gives birth to her first child and that after it takes a time of low, is more than likely that we don't see her with a tiara to within several months.</p>"

I have always been so open with you all about my family, fitness, Mommy... and I don't want to keep this from you, just because it isn't as positive and shiny as the rest.

I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester. This works for some, but I personally find it to be exhausting. I'm nauseous, tired, my body is changing. And I have to pretend that everything is just fine-and it truly isn't. I don't want to have to pretend anymore. I hope you understand. So, this is what is going on now: the embryo has a heartbeat, but it isn't strong, and the baby isn't growing very much. So we wait-and this is hard. So much uncertainty... but the chances are very, very small that this is a viable pregnancy. I have complete confidence that my family and I will get through this, even if the journey is difficult. I am so blessed with my amazing doctor, my dear friends, and my loving family... My husband and my four very healthy babies help me keep it together and have the perspective of how truly beautiful life is, even when it occasionally seems ugly. The luck and gratitude I feel that I am my babies' mommy, is wonderfully overwhelming and comforting. In your comments, please be kind. I'm feeling a bit fragile and I need support.

And it is that just the sister of Felipe VI opened the possibility of a transfer to a European city much nearer to the place where her husband,<strong> I√±aki Urdangar√≠n</strong> is serving sentence for their crimes related to the 'N√≥os' case.</p><p>As confirmed by the President of the Republic of Portugal,<strong> Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa </strong>- by the way great friend of the Kings don Felipe and Do√±a Letizia - has just been granted Portuguese citizenship to the <strong>Aga Khan</strong>. Rebelo de Sousa has taken advantage of the ceremony of the Agha Khan music awards which was held a few days ago in the Portuguese capital to announce the happy news: ""for me it is a huge pride to have as"" Portuguese citizen to this great citizen of the world"", he said.<p><p>Although the Aga Khan usually usually distribute their time between Paris and Geneva (place of birth), city in 2015 acquired in Lisbon the <strong>Palacete Henrique de Mendoza</strong> and pledged the <strong>Government of Passos Coelho</strong> to establish in the capital Lusa the headquarters of the UAE to change to be granted the citizenship and privileges normally only granted to embassies or diplomats, as certain tax exemptions. By virtue of this agreement, the UAE - the <strong>Aga Khan</strong> is head - is exempt from paying virtually all taxes during the next quarter-century.</p><p>A change of third that could benefit much the Infanta <strong>Do√±a Cristina</strong>, who for several years combines his work in La Caixa Foundation with collaborations in the <strong>Aga Khan Development Network, </strong>headquartered in Geneva and agreed thanks to the fact that the leader of the Ismaili is a close friend of King Juan Carlos.<p><p>However, now that the Aga Khan has moved the headquarters of the UAE to Portugal, Do√±a Cristina could assess a change of residence. A movement that would help that the Princess was not only closer to her husband, but also their parents, especially now that it is well received in Zarzuela since it repay its outstanding issues with justice. Also have to take into account important historical bonds of the Portuguese capital with Spain, which would encourage that Do√±a Cristina will find very comfortable in the city.</p><p>Waiting for the third grade</p><p>One of the fundamental reasons why the Do√±a Cristina might consider moving to the<strong> new headquarters of the UAE</strong> is undoubtedly its proximity to Spain, as well as its connection with the Bourbon family. Interested in the Princess be as closely as possible in Brieva de face a possible concession from third grade to I√±aki Urdangarin or a possible transfer of the exduque to a prison near the Portuguese border.<p><p>However, are several considerations to take into account that this can produce. The <strong>exduque of Palm</strong> now has ten months behind the <strong>walls of Brieva</strong> and so arises the possibility of third grade must have completed at least fifteen, so it would be in the month of December when the<strong> lawyers of I√±aki</strong> could request it.</p><p>The judge or court takes into account what are called 'variable General' as the family situation, the history, the type of crime, the duration of the penalty... and also the 'specific variable', that the internal refers to is qualified to lead a regime of semi-liberty. Much appreciates that the prisoner has a work and a close family member who can deal with it, something that today is difficult if one takes into account that the Princess is in Geneva, his mother and part of their brethren in Vitoria and his sister Anna in Barcelona.<p>"
